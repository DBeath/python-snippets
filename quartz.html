		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617451/now-its-nigerias-authorities-who-want-to-regulate-apps-like-whatsapp-and-facebook/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/ap_79323021973.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="WhatsApp and Facebook are among Nigeria&#039;s most popular OTT services." /><p>Nigerian regulators have kicked off a debate over whether to regulate so-called over-the-top (OTT) services in the country, it comes a month after <a href="http://qz.com/594278/south-africa-wants-to-regulate-whatsapp/">South Africa&#8217;s regulators made the same move</a>.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Skype, all immensely popular in Africa&#8217;s most populous nation, are all considered OTT services which telecoms carriers claim are posing a danger to their core business. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)  <a href="http://www.ncc.gov.ng/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_details&amp;gid=696&amp;Itemid=55">describes OTTs</a> as &#8216;services carried over the networks, delivering value to customers, but without any carrier service provider being involved in planning, selling, provisioning, or servicing them&#8217;. The NCC says this means traditional telecoms firms cannot directly earn revenue from OTTs.</p>
<p>The rise of OTT services are explained by a few statistics. In Nigeria, <a href="http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/192485-nigeria-internet-users-increase-to-97-million-ncc.html">almost 100 million people</a> in the country use the internet and the country&#8217;s smartphone penetration, <a href="http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/nigerians-take-to-mobile-for-better-media-content/52765/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HowWeMadeItInAfrica+%28How+We+Made+It+In+Africa%29">projected to reach 95 million by 2019</a>, currently  ranks only behind South Africa on the continent. Facebook, in particular, is <a href="http://qz.com/611516/more-people-use-facebook-in-nigeria-than-anywhere-else-in-africa/">hugely popular</a> as it records more monthly users in Nigeria than anywhere else in Africa.</p>
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="Ey9R9Inc" data-width="640" data-height="326"><img src="https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_Ey9R9Inc.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
<p>Regulating OTT services is not a new issue. Regulators <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/trai-seeks-to-regulate-ott-players-like-skype-viber-whatsapp-and-google-talk/">raised the issue in India</a> last year and more recently, regulating OTTs were also <a href="http://qz.com/594278/south-africa-wants-to-regulate-whatsapp/">brought to the fore in South Africa</a>.</p>
<p>While the telecoms firms&#8217; inability to earn revenue from OTTs is one thing, claims that they lose revenue as a result of the popular use of mobile messaging and internet calls replacing traditional calls and SMS is quite another. In this regard, the report describes OTTs as &#8216;a disruptive technology that is rapidly gaining ground against traditional telephone network technologies.&#8217; MTN, the country&#8217;s biggest network with regard to subscription base, saw its average revenue per user drop for most last year.</p>
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="Ny9qxEDWe" data-width="640" data-height="409"><img src="https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_Ny9qxEDWe.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
<p>In addition, the report claims that OTT services now overwhelm their telecoms&#8217; networks and with diminishing revenues, they have little incentive to invest and improve broadband capability. Even though networks earn revenue from data charges through which users access OTTs, the NCC report raises the need to evaluate the possibility of OTTs paying for the use of network  infrastructure. The NCC&#8217;s report also considers the security risks that OTTs portend. Given the lack of oversight, the regulator says there is a heightened risk of problems like identity theft and intercepting communications.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617578/indias-top-court-steps-in-to-clean-up-toxic-assets-in-the-banking-sector/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="362" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/supreme-court-of-india.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="india-supreme-court-bad-loans" /><p>The toxic loan problem in India&#8217;s banking system has become so grave that the country&#8217;s highest court has now stepped in to gauge the situation.</p>
<p>On Feb.16, a bench of the supreme court of India sought to know from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) the names of firms that have defaulted on loans worth Rs500 crore ($73 million) or above.</p>
<p>&#8220;We direct the RBI to file a detailed affidavit mentioning about the list of the companies which are defaulters of loans,&#8221; chief justice of India T S Thakur, who led the bench, said while <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/court-rbi-loans-idINKCN0VP19N" target="_blank">reading out the order</a>. The RBI has six weeks to submit the list.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decision could not have been more timely. India&#8217;s banks are bleeding due to the massive amounts of bad loans in the system. In the last two weeks, several public sector banks have reported a huge drop in their third quarter profits. India&#8217;s largest lender by assets, State Bank of India, posted a <a href="http://qz.com/614971/quarterly-profits-at-indias-biggest-bank-have-fallen-by-a-jaw-dropping-62/" target="_blank">62% drop in profit</a>. Others, including Allahabad Bank, Dena Bank, and the Central Bank of India, have <a href="http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget-banking-financial-services/article-psu-banks-book-highest-ever-loss-as-bad-loans-mount-1277194" target="_blank">reported losses.</a></p>
<p>This is mainly because the banks had to increase provisions towards non-performing assets (NPAs) in order to cover for defaults by March 2017—a target set by the RBI.</p>
<p>The gross NPAs among India&#8217;s listed banks <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Industry/ZQhav7x8FESxfLT1tHp0aO/Listed-banks-NPAs-surge-by-Rs1-trillion-in-December-quarter.html" target="_blank">have reportedly shot up to</a> Rs4.38 lakh crore as of the October-December quarter, compared to Rs3.4 lakh crore in the previous quarter.</p>
<h2>Corporate defaulters</h2>
<p>Most toxic loans in India belong to mid-size and large companies. The loans turn into NPAs when their principal or interest payment is delayed for more than 90 days—that means they have default.</p>
<p>India has already seen instances of big corporate defaults in the last few years. The most prominent one was <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/kingfisher-loan-default-only-a-trickle-vinod-rai/article6409759.ece" target="_blank">Kingfisher Airlines</a>, the beleaguered airline owned by Vijay Mallya. The company owes over Rs7,000 crore to nearly 17 banks.</p>
<p>Other defaulters from the past decade include <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ED-set-to-attach-assets-of-Indias-biggest-defaulter-Winsome-Diamonds/articleshow/48092759.cms" target="_blank">Winsome Diamonds</a>, a jewellery maker, and newspaper publisher <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/rbi-fines-12-banks-for-deccan-chronicle-default/" target="_blank">Deccan Chronicle Holdings</a>.</p>
<p>As of September 2015, of the total gross NPAs, restructured loans and written-off loans, 31.5% belonged to medium-sized companies, <a href="https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Speeches/PDFs/PPT1102166AB61D0F35C546539EF4DCD3C83B3668.pdf" target="_blank">according to data</a> from the RBI (pdf).</p>
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="EyoGfBhqe" data-width="640" data-height="294"><img src="https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_EyoGfBhqe.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, hardly any of these borrowers have been penalised heavily for their bad loans. RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has in the past said that big corporate &#8220;wrong-doers&#8221; should not be spared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only are we accused of not having the administrative capacity of ferreting out wrongdoing, we do not punish the wrong-doer—unless he is small and weak. This belief feeds on itself. No one wants to go after the rich and well-connected wrong-doer, which means they get away with even more,&#8221; he <a href="http://qz.com/593053/raghuram-rajans-no-bullshit-letter-on-how-indias-central-bank-must-get-in-shape/" target="_blank">wrote in a letter to RBI employees</a> last December.</p>
<p>But India&#8217;s top court, it appears, has other plans.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=617578&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617538/narendra-modi-and-the-fine-art-of-screwing-up/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/modi.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="India-Modi-JNU" /><p>It either says too little, or too much. It either does nothing, or furiously overreacts.</p>
<p>But no matter which route it has taken lately, the Narendra Modi government has managed to screw things up—with an uncanny talent for bad timing.</p>
<p>Its recent ineptitude at handling the levers of democracy has preceded the last two sessions of parliament, with the ensuing fracas blocking the passage of key reforms that the Indian economy so badly needs.</p>
<p>And now, thanks to the Bharatiya Janata Party&#8217;s (BJP&#8217;s) management of the affairs at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the upcoming budget session will once again showcase the full repertoire of moves India&#8217;s opposition parties have acquired to disrupt parliament.</p>
<p>In the process, the government is doing much more than merely damaging itself, or providing the opposition unending ammunition for ensuring parliamentary paralysis. Its political incompetence could potentially risk the recovery underway in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy.</p>
<h2>The tolerance tightrope</h2>
<p>The problem with the Modi government is its ambivalence over tolerance: It either tolerates too much, or too little.</p>
<p>When outrage over Lalitgate and the Vyapam scam erupted last summer, the BJP brass in New Delhi decided that tolerance was a virtue. The <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lalit-modi-visa-amit-shah-rajnath-singh-defend-sushma-swaraj/article7315160.ece">big guns were brought out</a> to defend foreign minister Sushma Swaraj&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sushma-swaraj-in-soup-over-lalit-modi-visa/article7316029.ece">purported involvement</a> in facilitating travel documents for the former Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi, even as the opposition bayed for her resignation. Questions over the propriety of Swaraj&#8217;s actions were simply sidestepped.</p>
<p>In the Vyapam scam, the bumbling response of the BJP&#8217;s Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, too, was deemed acceptable, although <a href="http://www.inc.in/resources/press-releases/869-Statement%20of%20Shri%20RPN%20Singh,%20Spokesperson,%20AICC">some openly questioned his complicity</a> in the matter. Eventually, it was only after <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/vyapam-is-chouhans-request-for-cbi-probe-a-last-minute-face-saving-stunt-2331538.html">much defence and drama</a> that the Modi government finally prodded the Central Bureau of Investigation into examining <a href="http://qz.com/445352/the-blood-soaked-trail-of-indias-massive-vyapam-scam/">the blood-soaked trail</a> of the $1 billion Vyapam scam.</p>
<p>This patience resulted in the <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/comment-5-reasons-why-the-monsoon-session-of-parliament-was-completely-wasted-2114164">washout of the monsoon session</a>.</p>
<p>But the tables quickly turned once beef was put on the menu. The Modi government deemed that there would be no tolerance for matters to do with the cow and protecting the BJP&#8217;s version of Hinduism. So, as the outcry against the beef ban, the lynching of Mohammed Akhlaq and other actions of right-wing groups grew to a crescendo, with authors, poets and playwrights <a href="http://qz.com/524798/indian-authors-are-returning-the-countrys-most-prestigious-literary-award-in-protest/">returning their awards</a>, the BJP leadership chose to fight back.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s culture minister Mahesh Sharma <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/mahesh-sharmas-wisdom-danish-injury-shows-no-desire-to-lynch-17-yr-old-girl-wasnt-touched-in-dadri-incident/">theorised that the death</a> of Akhlaq was an accident. Sangeet Som, another BJP lawmaker, <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/in-dadri-sangeet-som-accuses-up-govt-of-framing-innocent-for-lynching-incident/">warned that if innocents were framed</a> for Akhlaq&#8217;s death, there would be a &#8220;befitting reply&#8221;, presumably from Hindus. Sakshi Maharaj, a BJP member of parliament, declared that he was &#8220;ready to kill and get killed&#8221; to protect the cow.</p>
<p>Higher up the order, finance minister Arun Jaitley questioned if the protests and the returning of awards were &#8220;a contrived anger and a manufactured dissent.&#8221; And Modi, when he finally spoke, had actually <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prime-minister-modi-breaks-silence-on-dadri-lynching-episode/article7738896.ece" target="_blank">very little to say</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe foreboding of the coming chaos forced the BJP to <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ahead-of-winter-session-of-parliament-govt-reaches-out-to-opposition/1/531044.html">reach out to the opposition parties</a> before the winter session, but whatever consensus was forged quickly dissipated after the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/national-herald-case-sonia-rahul-gandhi-to-appear-before-court-on-saturday/">National Herald case</a> entered the picture.</p>
<p>With Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi compelled to appear in court for a case filed by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy in 2012, India&#8217;s grand old party decided to block and tackle. Others like the Trinamool Congress and the Janata Dal (United) joined in.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the opposition ensured that the winter session <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Politics/opwmBMoRuRfwc6glsHKf7I/Winter-session-of-Parliament-too-headed-for-a-washout.html">didn&#8217;t achieve much either</a>.</p>
<h2>Expect the expected</h2>
<p>If the prevailing anger against the Modi government&#8217;s entirely disproportionate response to the events at JNU—and the subsequent incident at the Patiala House courts—is any indication, the upcoming budget session could be effectively over even before it begins.</p>
<p>With several state polls on the horizon, every party worth its salt will likely be out to score political points and take potshots, particularly those against Modi and the BJP. End result: More disruption.</p>
<p>And that disruption could potentially levy a heavy toll on the Indian economy, one that Modi promised to build and nurture into delivering double-digit growth. Already, last November, credit-rating agency Moody’s Investors Services <a href="http://qz.com/559388/narendra-modis-moment-of-truth-as-parliaments-winter-session-begins/">warned that</a> the “investment environment is unlikely to pick up without the key reforms amidst weak global growth.”</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2015, the government tried but failed to enact legislation relating to key reforms—goods and services tax and land acquisition—as it lacks majority in the upper house of the parliament. The government is unlikely to win a majority in the upper house if it keeps losing state elections like it did recently in Delhi and Bihar. Opposition parties are unlikely to allow key reforms to go through,&#8221; the Moody&#8217;s report added.</p>
<p>The numbers, despite the revised GDP growth data, <a href="http://qz.com/612371/why-indias-gdp-numbers-need-to-be-taken-with-a-generous-helping-of-salt/">don&#8217;t look particularly promising</a>. Industrial activity in key infrastructure sectors is still sluggish, exports are falling and capacity utilisation in Indian factories is dropping. That&#8217;s why keen observers of the economy, such as Japan&#8217;s Nomura, cautioned earlier in February that India&#8217;s economic momentum is <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-07/news/70421196_1_growth-momentum-consumption-demand-cent-gdp-growth">already slowing down</a>.</p>
<p>There is, of course, some corrective action that Jaitley can, and probably will, spell out in his budget at the end of this month, but the big reforms must necessarily find their way through parliament. No amount of hoopla over Make in India will draw much-needed investment to the subcontinent as much as making deep and necessary changes to the economy will.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a reality that Modi and his government surely understand, which is why its crude reaction to the protest at JNU—given its political repercussions—is somewhat difficult to decipher. Perhaps it is another costly mistake. Or, it is a talent for screwing up, which has, so far, gone unnoticed.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/618168/china-has-deployed-surface-to-air-missiles-to-a-disputed-island-in-the-south-china-sea/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="427" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/rtr3p5c6-e1455685154683.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="The Chinese Coast Guard is getting some extra help." /><p>Tensions over China&#8217;s activities in the South China Sea just went up a notch. Satellite imagery has revealed the Chinese military&#8217;s deployment of an advanced surface-to-air missile system to Woody Island, part of the contested Paracel chain and also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.</p>
<p>After Fox News <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/02/16/exclusive-china-sends-suface-to-air-missiles-to-contested-island-in-provocative-move.html">first reported on</a> the satellite images showing the deployment, Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-missiles-idUSKCN0VP2VT">confirmed today with Taiwan&#8217;s defense ministry</a> that the missile batteries had been set up on the island. A US defense official also confirmed the &#8220;apparent deployment&#8221; of the missiles.</p>
<p>Imagery is from ImageSat International and reveals two batteries of eight surface-to-air missile launchers, plus a radar system, on Woody Island, Fox reported. The weaponry arrived over the past week or so, judging by satellite imagery. What had been an empty area on Feb. 3 was occupied by the missiles by Feb. 14.</p>
<p>On Jan. 30, a US Navy destroyer sailed within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island—also part of the Paracels—in a freedom-of-navigation exercise. A few days later, China’s foreign-ministry spokesman <a href="http://qz.com/606919/chinese-state-media-railed-against-another-incursion-by-a-us-warship-in-the-south-china-sea/">called that action</a> “dangerous and irresponsible” and said the US was “seriously harming relevant regional peace and stability.&#8221; A subsequent column in the state-controlled Xinhua newswire said, “Facts have proved that China, instead of doing any harm to the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, has provided public services to ensure the safety of all vessels sailing in the waters.”</p>
<p>After China added runways and other facilities to its manmade islands in the sea&#8217;s similarly contested Spratly archipelago, it also <a href="http://qz.com/527289/chinas-south-china-sea-island-building-is-for-the-public-good-says-china/">claimed they were</a> merely for civilian use, and argued that its intent with the new infrastructure was to provide services to passing ships.</p>
<p>It is unclear what services surface-to-air missiles might provide to passing ships or civilians.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=618168&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617389/in-modis-india-there-are-only-two-sets-of-people-nationals-and-anti-nationals/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/protest.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="India-national-patriotism" /><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight:400;">I wonder how much the ISI pays you for being their voice in India. As a country, we suffer more because bastards like you are around&#8230; you would never get till you suffer yourself&#8230;”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This wasn’t from a troll. It was from a friend. When he eloped with his then girlfriend to Mumbai a few years ago, my home was where the new couple first arrived. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Now, he is angry that my Facebook posts are critical of prime minister Narendra Modi and his government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">My friend is bewildered that anyone could be against a man who epitomises his brand of nationalism: rough, narrow, intimidating, and uncompromising.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For him, I am an “anti-national.”</span></p>
<p>Less than halfway through Modi&#8217;s five-year term, there has been a surge in hyper-nationalism in India that deems any critical view of the government—its ideology or its actions—&#8221;anti-national.&#8221; But not terribly long ago, “anti-nationals” were people who acted against the nation’s interest. Not those who expressed ideas, howsoever blasphemous, in college debates, tea-stall <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adda_(South_Asian)" target="_blank">addas</a>,</i> or on social media.</p>
<p>The term has quickly become part of the lexicon that derides secularism and mocks liberalism. And, of course, you can either be a patriot—a righteous defender of the government in New Delhi—or an anti-national. There is nothing in between.</p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">During the protests at New Delhi&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35560518" target="_blank">Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)</a> last week, a section of the crowd evidently raised slogans against India, but that wasn&#8217;t exactly the same as</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> acting against the nation. As political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta, <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jnu-sedition-case-kanhaiya-kumar-arrest-afzal-guru-event/" target="_blank">writing in the Indian Express</a>, explained: </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the students may have been deeply misguided in the beliefs they hold. But a university is the space to debate them: yes, even the hanging of Afzal Guru. But nothing they said amounts to a definition of illegality that should befit a liberal democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Instead, the farcical, heavy-handed response by the authorities was more problematic, followed by the even more troubling media coverage and social media outrage that branded the entire university &#8220;anti-national.”</span></p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data->
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If &quot;anti-national&quot; slogans are against the law, it only means that from being colonised by the British, we are now colonised by patriotism.</p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The repercussions of that hyperbole were clear at Delhi&#8217;s </span><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jnu-kanhaiya-kumar-patiala-house-court-lawyers-media-attacked/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400;">Patiala House courts on Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (Feb. 15) where a mob of lawyers beat up JNU students as well as those suspected to be JNU students, besides journalists. A</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker </span><a href="http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/bjp-mla-caught-on-cam-assaulting-a-person-justifies-delhi-court-violence-1203509.html?utm_source=IBN%20News" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400;">at the court even justified the lynching</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> of anyone who raised pro-Pakistan slogans. The police simply watched. </span></p>
<p>Never mind the nuances of debating free speech, for the defenders of patriotism to turn aggressive, one only needs to deviate a wee bit from the government&#8217;s line.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So, you don’t think Make in India </span><span style="font-weight:400;">will work? You think Modi is merely a showman? You think the GDP numbers are cooked up? You think Modi has gone back on most of his poll promises? You are an incorrigible anti-national. </span></p>
<p>The attempt is to make hyper-nationalism the new normal.</p>
<p>“It is because the term anti-national has certain resonance in today’s times that it is now being used in the derisive manner, as an abuse,” sociologist Dipankar Gupta, professor at Greater Noida-based Shiv Nadar University, explained.</p>
<p>“In a modern liberal democracy, nationalism or anti-nationalism should not matter,&#8221; he added, &#8220;It is citizenship that must matter. Citizenship involves certain legal rights that nobody can deny.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this is an abuse legitimised from the top of the BJP&#8217;s political structure. In the wake of the horrific Dadri lynching in September 2015<strong>, </strong>Haryana’s BJP chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/muslims-can-live-in-this-country-but-they-will-have-to-give-up-eating-beef-says-haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar/" target="_blank">proposed that</a> Muslims can live in India only if they give up beef.</p>
<p>Five months later, a<span style="font-weight:400;">nother BJP chief minister, Maharashtra’s Devendra Fadnavis, </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="https://in.news.yahoo.com/raising-doubts-headleys-claim-anti-national-fadnavis-130051016.html" target="_blank">decided that</a> all those who doubted</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> David Headley&#8217;s </span><a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ishrat-jahan-was-an-let-suicide-bomber-headley-to-nia-422832" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400;">testimony on Ishrat</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ishrat-jahan-was-an-let-suicide-bomber-headley-to-nia-422832" target="_blank"> Jahan</a> must be &#8220;anti-national.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The whole idea, says Vikas Bajpai, assistant professor, Centre for Social Medicine at JNU, is this: “First they will appropriate the right to decide who is a national and who is anti-national, irrespective of what the law says. Then they will appropriate the right to punish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly like the proceedings at the Patiala House courts.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617950/a-prize-winning-space-archaeologist-needs-your-help-finding-looted-archeological-sites/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/lead_22395169123_b2e8de749e_o.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="Indiana Jones, with satellite technology." /><p style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vancouver</p>
<p>A space archeologist is what happens when Indiana Jones and a Google Earth (goddess) have a love-child. This is how <a href="http://www.sarahparcak.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Parcak</a>, winner of the TED Prize, described her work in a recent interview with Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p>To parlay its &#8220;ideas worth spreading&#8221; motto into action, TED, the ideas festival of the world&#8217;s elite, bestows a million-dollar prize on<strong> </strong>an exceptional individual with a game-changing idea for improving the world. <a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes">Past winners</a> include rock musician Bono, writer Dave Eggers, anti-corruption campaigner Charmian Gooch, and <a href="http://qz.com/364953/storycorps-deploys-the-largest-global-oral-history-project-and-theres-an-app-for-that/">StoryCorps</a> founder David Isay. Per tradition, the winner frames his or her bold plan through a wish.</p>
<p>Since being named the winner in November 2015, Parcak, a University of Alabama professor, has been mulling over how best to use the seed money from TED. Before the 2,000+ <a href="http://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/how-ted-works/ted-brain-trust">high-powered<strong> </strong>audience</a><b> </b>in Vancouver, Canada and thousands watching online, tonight Parcak revealed her big wish:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wish for us to discover the millions of unknown archaeological sites across the globe. By creating a 21st-century army of global explorers, we’ll find and protect the world’s hidden heritage, which contains humankind’s collective resilience and creativity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her vision is to deploy a &#8220;massive, crowd-sourced online distance science campaign,&#8221; as she<b> </b>describes it.</p>
<p>The first part of Parcak&#8217;s ambitious plan is a mobile app. Working with game designers, she&#8217;s designing an interface that will teach people the scientifically correct way to read high-resolution satellite data and spot undetected pyramids, ancient towns, and &#8220;looting pits&#8221;—deep holes on the ground that looters have dug up in search of antiquities and archaeological artifacts.</p>
<figure id="image-617957" class="inline-image  alignright zoomable size-small"><img src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/16076574468_6375bf35ab_o.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=543" data-retina="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/16076574468_6375bf35ab_o.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=543" alt="" title=""/><figcaption class="inline-image-caption"><i class="icon-camera"></i><span class="inline-image-credit">(NASA)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These pits are fairly easy to identify, Parcak says.&#8221;They&#8217;re small dark circles typically surrounded by a donut-shaped [pile] of earth.&#8221; The real problem is the lack of time for over-taxed scientists. She explains that there are only about two dozen archeologists around the world specifically focused on monitoring looted sites.</p>
<p>Parcak, a <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/sarah-parcak/" target="_blank">pioneering Egyptologist</a> who helped discover the ancient city of Tanis, is part of a cadre of dedicated archeologists and academics sounding alarms about the looting and destruction of heritage sites in places like Egypt, Iraq, and Syria. Last year, UNESCO said that the breadth of ISIL’s deliberate and strategic campaign to demolish historical sites has reached an “industrial scale.”</p>
<p>Parcak says that the found sites will not be tagged with GPS coordinates, in order to protect their location.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t do something in the next couple of years, all this will be gone,&#8221; says Parcak. &#8220;We&#8217;re losing the battle to the looters.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hopes that millions of concerned or curious users—kids, housewives, students, scientists—will participate in the program and help archeologists accelerate their surveillance work. &#8220;We truly want the world to be engaged with this. If we don&#8217;t get the world excited about discovery, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to make any headway.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=617950&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content>

The industry peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, making directors like John Woo international stars. Since then, it has suffered a huge drop in output and profits as Hollywood and mainland China drew bigger audiences and lured away Hong Kong&#8217;s talent.</p>
<p>But a recent, little-advertised Hong Kong film,<em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Years_%28film%29">Ten Years</a></em>, has been a surprise hit. The movie is a collection of vignettes that imagine a dystopian Hong Kong 10 years in the future, as Beijing&#8217;s growing influence over the city entails mandatory Mandarin language for residents, fake, fatal, terrorism incidents to scare the citizens, and a ban of the word &#8220;local.&#8221; In one segment, a Hong Kong resident self-immolates.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/46OjIXuF1f4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Hong Kong viewers tell Quartz they, and many others in the audience, have left packed screenings in tears, because of the frightening similarities between the movie and <a href="http://qz.com/588511/a-crackdown-on-hong-kong-booksellers-reflects-the-deep-divides-in-chinas-communist-party/">what&#8217;s happening in Hong Kong</a> now. Time Out Hong Kong <a href="http://www.timeout.com.hk/film/features/75349/the-filmmakers-behind-ten-years-on-the-resonating-success-of-their-dystopian-vision.html">described it</a> as a &#8220;nightmarish,&#8221; &#8220;frightening&#8221; must-see for Hong Kongers. The South China Morning Post <a href="http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1892429/film-review-ten-years-hongkongers-worst-post-occupy-fears-depicted">said it served</a> as &#8220;a reminder of the power of independent, intelligent film-making as a vehicle for social and political critique.&#8221; China&#8217;s state-backed Global Times, meanwhile, called it a &#8220;<a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/01/22/state-newspaper-says-dystopian-hk-film-ten-years-is-ridiculous-and-promotes-desperation/">virus of the mind</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>But after just two months, the film is no longer screening anywhere in Hong Kong. Some theater owners <a href="http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/entertainment/art/20160115/19452345">say the move</a> (link in Chinese) has nothing to do with self-censorship, but it seems hard to justify for economic reasons.</p>
<p>Though the movie played in fewer than 10 theaters at its peak, and only had a run of eight weekends, it <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&amp;view=bycountry&amp;id=_fTENYEARS201">made nearly HK$6 million</a>, more than 10 times what it cost to make. The movie outperformed the new <em>Star Wars</em> film in at least one theater when it opened (both movies opened in the same week), and bested the Disney blockbuster in <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?id=_fTENYEARS201&amp;country=HK&amp;wk=2016W3&amp;id=_fTENYEARS201&amp;p=.htm">box office earnings in Hong Kong</a> in three of the past four weekends, even though it played in far fewer theaters.</p>
<figure id="image-617478" class="inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium"><img src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/box_office_star_wars_ten_years_chartbuilder-1.png?w=640" data-retina="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/box_office_star_wars_ten_years_chartbuilder-1.png?w=1024" alt="" title=""/></figure>
<p><em>Star Wars</em> is <a href="http://m.amccinemas.com.hk/amc/list_detail.php?lang=e&amp;movie_id=8623">still playing</a> in several cinemas this week, but after showing on one screen <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/hongkong/?yr=2016&amp;wk=7&amp;p=new">this past weekend</a>, <em>Ten Years </em>has gone.</p>
<p>When Hong Kong restaurant Daimanya offered free tickets to the film for patrons in a Feb. 7 private screening, thousands of people <a href="https://www.facebook.com/36221622jp/photos/a.1644866125770366.1073741829.1635024920087820/1683970028526642/?type=3&amp;theater">responded on Facebook</a>. The restaurant had to choose 97 of them, and when it tried to set up a second screening, the cinema where it held the first stopped responding to messages, a restaurant spokesman told Quartz. The restaurant has no “political stance,” he said. “We are supporting the creative arts made in Hong Kong.”</p>
<p>Although <em>Ten Years</em> may no longer be watchable in Hong Kong, it may be shown overseas soon.</p>
<p>International rights for <em>Ten Years</em> have been picked up by distributor Golden Scene, <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/golden-scene-hong-kong-ten-years-1201705864/">Variety reports</a>. The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/company/co0121860/">distributor specializes in</a> bringing artsy and independent films to Hong Kong and screening locally-made movies overseas.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=615831&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/618022/ubers-ceo-says-the-company-is-burning-1-billion-a-year-in-china/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/travis-kalanick-gesticulating-e1455662570195.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="¯\_(ツ)_/¯" /><p>It&#8217;s no secret that Uber is burning cash in China, the only question has been how much. The answer, per a recent interview with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, is more than $1 billion a year.</p>
<p>“We’re profitable in the USA, but we’re losing over $1 billion a year in China,&#8221; Kalanick said in a &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; in Vancouver, according to <a href="http://betakit.com/travis-kalanick-speaks-out-ubers-ceo-on-risk-regulation-and-women-in-tech/">Betakit</a>. &#8220;We have a fierce competitor that’s unprofitable in every city they exist in, but they’re buying up market share.&#8221; (Uber didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment on Betakit&#8217;s report.)</p>
<p>The fierce competitor that Kalanick is talking about is Didi Kuaidi, the no. 1 taxi and ride-hailing player in China. The funding war between Uber and Didi Kuaidi has escalated over the last few months. Didi Kuaidi is valued at $16.5 billion after securing $3 billion in September. Uber&#8217;s China unit closed its own <a href="http://qz.com/591044/uber-might-have-to-settle-for-being-the-lyft-of-china/">series B round</a> about a month ago, the size and valuation of which weren&#8217;t disclosed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish the world wasn’t that way. I prefer building rather than fundraising,&#8221; Kalanick reportedly said at the fireside chat. &#8220;But if I don’t participate in the fundraising bonanza, I’ll get squeezed out by others buying market share.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no good up-to-date data on how wide Didi Kauidi&#8217;s lead is in China, as of August Uber was far behind.</p>
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="4kmKOY3C" data-width="640" data-height="262"><img src="https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_4kmKOY3C.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
<p>Kalanick is personally overseeing Uber&#8217;s expansion in China, which he last summer declared the company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/09/25/uber_makes_a_big_bet_on_carpooling_with_ubercommute_in_chengdu_china.html">top global priority</a>.&#8221; The densely populated cities in the Middle Kingdom offer Uber growth potential that it can only dream of in the US. That should help explain why Kalanick is pursuing it so aggressively, despite the tremendous burn rate, and the fact that China is a notoriously tough market for foreign internet companies to crack. Even if Uber never advances past runner up, in China that&#8217;s <a href="http://qz.com/591044/uber-might-have-to-settle-for-being-the-lyft-of-china/">still a pretty good place to be</a>.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=618022&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617714/citigroup-analysts-think-googles-parent-company-should-buy-aig/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="396" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/rtxagje.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="Citi analysts think that AIG should be bought by...Google?" /><p class="p1"><span class="s1">AIG is an insurance company. Alphabet is the parent company of internet search giant Google. While there don&#8217;t seem to be many synergies on the surface, analysts at Citigroup think Alphabet should partner with an investment bank to buy AIG and turn it into an &#8220;insurance FinTech laboratory.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an investor note circulated today (Feb. 16), the </span>analysts acknowledged the proposal is &#8220;audacious&#8221; and that it&#8217;s a &#8220;very low probability event.&#8221; Still, they insisted it was a promising idea. It very well could be—the insurer&#8217;s massive trove of data could make it appealing to Alphabet. Meanwhile, AIG, which has been <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/aig-reaches-agreement-with-icahn-for-board-representation-1455226425">battling with activist investors</a> (paywall), could benefit from the shield of a parent company. The proposal also highlights overlaps between tech and finance, beyond just payments.</p>
<p class="p1">Among the trends Citi analysts based the proposal on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">The rise of &#8220;modular finance.&#8221; Whereas financial institutions have traditionally sold a whole suite of products to customers, modular finance—a term coined by consulting firm Oliver Wyman—describes how technology is assembling complex offerings on the fly, &#8220;forcing finance firms to be best of breed for each product.&#8221;</li>
<li class="p1">A lack of significant disruption in insurance. Tech companies have largely stayed away from insurance because it&#8217;s highly regulated, &#8220;interconnected, and hard to automate.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Citi thinks a Google-AIG innovation lab could take address these and more. While Google gets an experienced insurance team and decades of data, AIG gets a parent company that&#8217;s <a href="http://qz.com/607465/we-now-know-how-much-money-alphabet-loses-on-its-non-google-business/" target="_blank">already betting heavily</a> on moonshots (and losing quite a bit of money doing so).</p>
<p>Of course, Google shareholders won&#8217;t be happy acquiring a volatile insurance giant—not to mention the regulatory headaches that would come with it. That&#8217;s where the investment bank partnership comes in: Google would take control of &#8220;data and strategic development&#8221;and the investment bank could get new businesses to securitize.</p>
<p>Most of this sounds nice for AIG, whose CEO, coincidentally, had some very nice things to say about Alphabet&#8217;s corporate structure recently. As <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/google-parent-should-buy-aig-an-audacious-idea-from-citigroup" target="_blank">Bloomberg notes</a>, Peter Hancock last month likened his company to Alphabet when he announced AIG would create nine “modules” to improve accountability and add transparency for investors.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=617714&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617627/amazon-is-suiting-up-to-fight-for-indias-mobile-shoppers/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/amazon-india-mobile.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="Amazon is on track to acquire Indian firm Emvantage, a mobile payments company." /><p>With roughly a fifth of the world’s population but only 12% of its internet users, India remains a curious case for e-commerce companies looking to tap into the rapidly-developing market.</p>
<p>For one, more than 50% of Amazon&#8217;s Indian customers <a href="http://qz.com/591356/indias-love-of-cash-has-created-a-tricky-problem-for-amazon/">still use cash for online purchases.</a> That&#8217;s created a complicated logistics situation in which a constellation of local shops serve as both payment center and pick-up spot for online goods.</p>
<p>But with Amazon&#8217;s announcement Tuesday (Feb. 16) that it intends to purchase Indian online payments firm Emvantage, the company looks to be turning to the mobile phone as a key part of its strategy to gain market share. Emvantage gives Amazon the technological foundation to make online shopping more convenient with services that include a mobile prepaid wallet, which could cut the dependency on using cash when making online purchases. The Seattle-based e-commerce giant did not disclose the price of the deal, and Amazon India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<span class="pull-quote"><span class="quote-line">&nbsp;</span><span>I think Amazon is playing a little catch up.</span><span class="quote-line">&nbsp;</span></span>
<p>The purchase may be a sign that Amazon learned from its experience in China, where competitor Alibaba developed its Alipay service, and JD.com <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-tencent-hldg-idUSBREA2902T20140310">partnered with Tencent</a> to use its WeChat mobile services. WeChat, for example, has 93% penetration in its major cities where users can use the app for online shopping, ordering taxis, paying bills, finding dates, and much more.</p>
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="4yF9fmhcx" data-width="640" data-height="409"><img src="https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_4yF9fmhcx.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
<p>In India, Alibaba is already making moves in the mobile-shopping market by investing in Paytm, a popular mobile platform that works much like PayPal. Amazon&#8217;s purchase of Emvantage could be a crucial move for Amazon to gain ground in mobile payments, said Kartik Hosanagar, of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Amazon is playing a little catch up,&#8221; Hosanagar told Quartz.</p>
<p>The purchase of Emvantage also makes sense when looking at data on internet and mobile phone use in the world&#8217;s second most populous country. According to the World Bank and the Internet and Mobile Association of India, the number of Indians with mobile phones outnumber those with personal computers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=617627&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617777/spotify-ceo-without-us-the-music-business-would-be-dead/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/rtr31tlr.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="Preaching from the pulpit." /><p>Last night&#8217;s Grammy awards were aflutter with more than just songs and gossip. Particularly in the spotlight was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Recording_Arts_and_Sciences">Recording Academy</a> president Neil Portnow, who spent his time on stage aiming punches at the music streaming industry for delivering less-than-lucrative profits to artists. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t a song worth more than a penny?&#8221; Portnow demanded. (For those feeling major déjà vu: He delivered <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/grammys-2015/6465670/grammys-2015-neil-portnow-streaming-payouts">much the same rant</a> at last year&#8217;s Grammys.)</p>
<p>Today (Feb. 16), Daniel Ek—CEO and co-founder of Spotify, the leading music streaming service in the world right now with nearly <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1159aca6-d1e3-11e5-92a1-c5e23ef99c77.html#axzz40MI2pyWV">30 million paying subscribers</a>—struck back with his own opinions on music streaming&#8217;s place in the broader business. In a Q&amp;A session on Quora, Ek replied to the following query:</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you respond to some artists&#8217; claims that music streaming services are harmful to the industry?</p></blockquote>
<p>With the following <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-respond-to-some-artists-claims-that-music-streaming-services-are-harmful-to-the-industry">answer</a> (excerpted):</p>
<blockquote><p>Look, we pay the great majority of our revenue back to the music indsutry [<em>sic</em>]. And as we grow, that revenue is really making a difference. Many people don’t realize that the music industry was in decline throughout all the download years (with a one-year exception in which it was basically flat). Now, finally, after years and years of decline, music is growing again, streaming is behind the growth in music, and Spotify is behind the growth in streaming.</p></blockquote>
<p>In essence, Ek is claiming Spotify and co. are actually responsible for the music business&#8217;s continued success. &#8220;We are all in this together,&#8221; he wrote in the Quora answer, insisting that Spotify is &#8220;committed&#8221; to the success of songwriters and producers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true the company pays a big chunk of its revenues to record labels and artists. But that chunk, when divvied up, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/7/9861372/spotify-year-in-review-artist-payment-royalties">doesn&#8217;t come out</a> to very much for individual music-makers at all. Many artists are in revolt. Taylor Swift and Radiohead&#8217;s Thom Yorke both publicly pulled music from Spotify in protests of its meager payouts; Adele, Prince, and several others have followed suit.</p>
<p>Some of these moves may have been pretty effective. A few months ago, Spotify decided to tamp down on its original all-music-should-be-free attitude and allow some artists to <a href="http://qz.com/569046/spotify-is-abruptly-backtracking-some-music-will-now-only-be-available-for-paying-users/">exclusively release content on the service&#8217;s paid tier</a>, which yields more profit than its ad-supported free tier. If the rebellions keep up, Spotify—and Ek—may be forced to sing a different tune: one that&#8217;s not so much about the benefits streaming poses for the music industry, but rather the concessions it should make.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=617777&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://qz.com/617808/watch-the-saudi-russian-oil-freeze-fizzle-before-your-eyes/"><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/h_52591755.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="The frozen four." /><p>Yesterday evening (Feb. 15), word spread that the oil ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabian had made a breakthrough: after years of failure to find common ground on almost any subject of substance, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/saudi-arabia-and-russia-agree-oil-output-freeze-in-qatar-talks">these two titans had agreed</a> to freeze petroleum production, a demonstration of resolve to reduce the global glut of crude and push rock-bottom prices back up. They got Qatar and Venezuela on board, too.</p>
<p>After nearly two years of plummeting prices, it was terrific news. The oil industry&#8217;s misery—American shale companies have been pushed into bankruptcy, supermajors have slashed spending and cut tens of thousands of jobs, and oil-producing states including Russia and Saudi Arabia have resorted to dire fiscal measures—was perhaps nearing an end.</p>
<p>Traders pushed the oil price up in anticipation of a more balanced global market.</p>
<figure id="image-618006" class="inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium"><img src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/brentprice1.png?w=640" data-retina="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/brentprice1.png?w=1024" alt="" title=""/></figure>
<p>And then word came of an agreement to &#8220;freeze&#8221; output at January levels. Prices briefly spiked before the reality of the deal dawned on traders. Both Russia and Saudi have been drilling at record levels—Russia at 10.8 million barrels a day, and Saudi not much lower. That headlong production wouldn&#8217;t go higher, but it wouldn&#8217;t go any lower either. The rally started to fizzle.</p>
<figure id="image-618007" class="inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium"><img src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/brentprice2.png?w=640" data-retina="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/brentprice2.png?w=1024" alt="" title=""/></figure>
<p>The purported freeze had one crucial caveat—Iran had to agree to keep production at current levels, too. There is an exceedingly slender chance of that happening—no chance, really—since Iran was only freed from international sanctions a month ago.</p>
<p>Tehran plans to increase production by 600,000 to 1 million barrels a day this year, and thus revive market share it lost to the Saudis and others over the past two or three years. If it agreed to freeze now, it would give up that chase almost immediately. In other words, there is no freeze. Prices promptly resumed their downwards spiral.</p>
<figure id="image-618009" class="inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium"><img src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/brentprice3.png?w=640" data-retina="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/brentprice3.png?w=1024" alt="" title=""/></figure>
<p>And the rout continues&#8230;</p>
