I mean, we call them killer whales. A pod of these water locked marauders are living up to their name as they go on a killing spree in California's Monterey Bay &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/28/large-number-of-orcas-reported-sighted-killing-gray-whales-in-monterey-bay/" target="_blank"&gt;according to Nancy Black&lt;/a&gt;, a marine biologist in the area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The pod involved in every single one of the kills is about nine strong. Recently, the pod treated a crew of whale watchers to a lifetime of nightmares when they slaughtered a grey whale calf in front of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div data-iframely-id="s3nUIoN" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/s3nUIoN?playerjs=true&amp;app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black said that since April 20 they have taken down &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/gowhales/photos/a.247878725309870.51754.170012223096521/1236631026434630/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank"&gt;five grey whale calves in ten days&lt;/a&gt; and that an orca she calls Emma is leading the attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "It's her mother, (Emma) her daughter, and her granddaughter, plus another couple of her offspring," Black told &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/28/large-number-of-orcas-reported-sighted-killing-gray-whales-in-monterey-bay/" target="_blank"&gt;the Mercury News&lt;/a&gt;. "So it's a whole family, because killer whales do live in family groups."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Emma and the rest of her fam have been joined by other orcas who want in on the fun. The first kill involved about 33 of the creatures—the hanger-ons probably came after hearing folktales of about the the crew. As for why this particular pod is so bloodthirsty, the explanations vary. It may be because the grey whales were late migrating to the bay this year so the orcas were particularly hungry for their traditional meal of baby grey whale, or they may be teaching their young to hunt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Read More: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/killer-whales-due-to-climate-change-may-become-the-norths-top-killer"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Thanks to Climate Change, Killer Whales May Become the North's Top Predator&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Either way, Black said that the Emma and her pod are "very good" at killing. They were able to murk a grey whale calf in 20 minutes the other day—something that takes a typical pod several hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It is unknown whether the orcas will continue their killing spree but, for good measure, take my hand child, let us pray they never &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwXgDxXB0A0" target="_blank"&gt;find out&lt;/a&gt; about their brethren we keep in

And yet I’m sold.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt; I'd expected to hear a lot of convincing arguments that would persuade me to sign up to have my body cryogenically frozen when I die, but proving that I'm more rational than Paris Hilton wasn't one of them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "About ten years ago there was a rumor going around that she had signed up to have her body preserved, so my colleagues and I worried that perhaps Paris Hilton was more rational than us," says Anders Sandberg, a research fellow with the University of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute. Sandberg is an expert on human "enhancement" who himself is signed up to be frozen one day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; On one level, of course, doing anything because Paris Hilton pressured you into it is a really bad idea, Sandberg admits. "But we humans are emotional beings, so the fact that some of our Oxford academic pride was wounded really did spurn us to bite the bullet."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As insane, or perhaps creepy, as it sounds, hundreds of people in the US are 'frozen,' stored in stainless steel chambers at a cozy -196°C in liquid nitrogen. Their cases are checked daily while they're kept "in stasis," as cryonic believers call it, waiting until new medical technologies can cure or repair whatever ailed them, whether it be a heart attack, dementia, or perhaps even cancer. At the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale Arizona, 150 "patients" are frozen in time, and another 996 have signed up for the same fate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Cryonics Institute in Clinton township, Michigan holds a similar number—150 humans, plus more than 100 pets. "Maybe the idea of reviving people who are cryogenically frozen sounds far-fetched, but in my field, you know that you can bring back the dead all the time," says Dennis Kowalski, a director at the Cyronics Institute who works as a paramedic by day. "I've been able to take a lot of what I learned from emergency medicine and integrate it into cryonics. You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Death is a process, and we simply slow that process down. I like to say that we provide the ambulance to the hospital of the future."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Moreover, Sandberg points out, there are thousands—if not millions—of people alive today who were once frozen sperm or egg cells, or frozen embryos. "In a sense, those people were cryonically frozen, and yet they are today alive," he says. Moving up in size, scientists &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2081623-frozen-rabbit-kidneys-could-solve-organ-shortage-for-transplants/" target="_blank"&gt;demonstrated last year&lt;/a&gt; that embryonic rabbit kidneys could be frozen, thawed, and grown into full-sized and fully functional organs, capable of transplant into living animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the wild, Canadian wood frogs &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070220-frog-antifreeze.html" target="_blank"&gt;annually freeze solid&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to special proteins in their blood that act as a natural antifreeze and prevent the formation of ice crystals that would cause cell damage—so it is theoretically possible for an entire body to be kept below freezing temperature and later revived. Cryonisists have already been replicating this strategy for decades: All preserved bodies are not technically "frozen," because all the blood is drained out the moment they legally die, and slowly replaced with a biological antifreeze (along with a cocktail of more than a dozen different drugs) that perfuses into the body and prevents ice crystals from forming and damaging cells. Hence why a body that would be a toasty 32°C can be kept at -196°C potentially indefinitely. But sperm, eggs, kidneys, and frogs are one thing. What about that most human of organs, the brain? There's no point in being revived if your memories, knowledge, and personality don't come with you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read the full story at &lt;a href="https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/the-creepy-insane-and-undeniably-romantic-world-of-cryonics"&gt;Tonic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="The Creepy, Insane, and Undeniably Romantic World of Cryonics" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-creepy-insane-and-undeniably-romantic-world-of-cryonics1" type="text/html"/><link title="The Creepy, Insane, and Undeniably Romantic World of Cryonics" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5905eebc0f195a14530334ba/lede/1493561123506-1493229460987-GettyImages-107254151.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Zoe Cormier</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Zoe Cormier</id></author><category term="immortality"/><category term="body"/><category term="mind"/><category term="preservation"/><category term="Tonic"/><category term="living forever"/><category term="cyronics"/><category term="cyrogenics"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-30-14</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-30T14:18:12.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>5904d18c4b1d8d144021d856</id><published>2017-04-29T18:05:27.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-29T18:05:27.000Z</updated><title>Seth Rogen Is Working on a Movie About a Terrible Music Festival</title><summary type="text">No, it’s not a documentary about the Fyre Festival.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt; So, turns out that Seth Rogen and the Lonely Island crew are working on a movie about a music festival going to shit. Talk about serendipitous timing, given they couldn't ask for a better marketing campaign than the dumpster fire that was the Fyre music festival. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "This seems like a good time to mention the movie we are making with [the Lonely Island] about a music festival that goes HORRIBLY WRONG," Rogen &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/858102183694348288" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Read more: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/what-it-was-like-at-fyre-festival-bahamas-ja-rule"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help, I'm Still Stuck in Hell, AKA Fyre Festival&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Lonely Island followed up with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thelonelyisland/status/858103575544709121" target="_blank"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; in which they jokingly said they were thinking about suing the people behind the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-iframely-id="wUwkl45" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-img="" data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/wUwkl45" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the few people uninitiated into the glory that is the Fyre Festival here's a little catch up: The festival was sold as a &lt;a href="https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/what-it-was-like-at-fyre-festival-bahamas-ja-rule"&gt;"luxury" music festival&lt;/a&gt; for loaded young people—one where they could mix with "influencers" and models. It was co-founded by Ja Rule and &lt;a href="https://news.vice.com/story/rich-millennials-paid-thousands-for-ja-rules-fyre-fest-and-are-now-stranded-on-an-island-in-disaster-relief-tents"&gt;Billy McFarland&lt;/a&gt;.

The festival goers went to Twitter to express their horror with the event and the internet, overdosing on rich kid schadenfreude, had a heyday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As for Rogen's movie, the details remain scarce but it's going to be an uphill battle to write anything funnier than rich millennials 'gramming their bread and cheese plates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; Follow &lt;a

for Johnny Cash Was a Nightmare</title><summary type="text">The untold story of Saul Holiff, Cash’s Canadian manager, who had to deal with the singer at the height of his addiction problems.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; The following is an excerpt from &lt;/i&gt;The Man Who Carried Cash&lt;i&gt;, an upcoming book about the tumultuous relationship between Johnny Cash and his Canadian manager, Saul Holiff. The book, written by Julie Chadwick (an occasional VICE writer), uses exclusive material found in Holiff's storage locker after his suicide in 2005, which includes audio diaries, hundreds of intimate letters and photos, audiotaped phone calls with Cash and newspaper clippings and press materials. In this excerpt, we come in on Johnny Cash and Saul Holiff in the first few months of 1967. Johnny is in the utter depths of addiction and has become known as Johnny "No Show" Cash among promoters. A previous show in Miami ended before it even began when a strung-out Johnny stumbled out onstage and begged Saul for help in front of the audience. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three weeks after the disastrous show in Miami, the Johnny Cash Show was scheduled for an extensive two-week tour on the turf of Harry "Hap" Peebles, the biggest promoter in the Midwest. Well-respected as one of the founders of the Country Music Association, he kept busy booking more than six hundred shows a year and set high standards for promotional work. This was not a man to cross. Though generally on good terms, Cash had once clashed with Peebles in 1961 over his incessant and unwanted romantic pursuit of Rose Maddox while on tour. Coming to her defence at a stop in North Dakota, Cash had slammed Peebles up against a wall and told him, "If you ever go near Rose again, I'll kill you." By 1967 the incident seemed to be mostly water under the bridge, but the entire Cash show soon realized they had other problems when they started the tour and, once again, Johnny was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Johnny blew off the first four dates," said Johnny Western. "The story was that Hap Peebles told Saul that Johnny had slipped on the ice in Nashville in front of Columbia Recording Studios, had fallen and cracked four ribs, and the doctor said he not only couldn't travel but he couldn't fly until his ribs were healed up. That was the official story."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; However, the true story was a little more complicated. With the divorce from Vivian imminent, Cash desperately wanted to be with June, but she had made it clear she would never marry him unless he overcame his drug addiction for good. At this point it was a hopeless request, as Cash was deeper in it than ever. It was around this time, before the two-week tour, that they got into a bitter argument over the issue, and according to some accounts, June swallowed some of his tranquilizers. Incensed, she then left for the tour, and after some discussion, June, Saul, and likely Marshall decided the cast would do the shows as planned — without Johnny. The primary goal was to fend off a lawsuit, combined with a fear of letting Hap Peebles down, but there was also an element of frustration involved over the lost revenue — this was work, after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "We did Fort Smith, Tulsa, and Oklahoma City without Johnny Cash, and then we heard this rumour that Johnny was furious that we were finishing the tour under his name and that he had had a confrontation with Hap," said Western. Cash was indeed incensed, and unleashed his wrath in a letter to June, which she then handed over to Saul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article__media"&gt;&lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 25em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 40.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 53.125em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481625402-IMAGE-4_1.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="article__image-caption"&gt; June Carter, Johnny Cash, and Saul Holiff, backstage in London, Ontario, 1964. [The London Free Press Collection of Photo Negatives, University of Western Ontario Archives] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnny viewed the situation as a betrayal, and told June she had effectively turned her back on him when she joined the other members of their troupe to do the shows without him. That act alone had more than repaid him for any wrongs he had done to her, he said. In his mind, he was hurt more by this than she had ever been. It was unfathomable to him. Was she not able to see how in every way he was working to become a better and stronger person? He had personally told her father, Ezra Carter, as much. Ezra was a man he deeply respected and with whom he had quickly bonded through their discussions of books and the nuances of religion. Johnny had told Ezra that he was going to "be the man they all were proud of," and had sincerely meant it. But now … what did this mean from June, exactly? Did she not see what they had as precious and valuable? Was this her way of dropping him? If so, "you need to think of doing it differently," he wrote. "For a long time you have been my future and I was yours," he continued, adding that it was hard to understand why she would potentially toss that future aside, and disregard all they had endured together, for a two-week tour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As for everyone else, and Saul, there were no words, he said. He needed an explanation from them personally. But if they insisted on continuing the tour without him, they needed to remove his name from any association with it. He also asked June to spare his feelings and be kind enough to not sing their duet with anyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Much of Johnny's wrath was also directed at Hap Peebles, whom he thought needed to be reminded of his place as a local promoter who was primarily contracted to present his show and little else, and who Johnny believed was under no authority to have acted the way he did. Feeling "disgraced, disregarded, disrespected and not believed," he wanted Peebles to be blacklisted. "You saw, and Hap will soon see, what you have done," Johnny finished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The duet Cash referred to in the letter was the popular section of their show in which he and June bantered, joked, and sang numbers like "It Ain't Me, Babe" and their newest song, "Jackson." Inspired by the play &lt;i&gt; Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&lt;/i&gt;, "Jackson" was written as a back-and-forth between a married couple. It was intimate, funny, and carried a natural chemistry. Part of their show for some time, their recording was released just before the February tour and was a minor hit for the couple when it went to number two on the country charts. It also later formed part of an entire album of duets rather humorously dubbed &lt;i&gt; Carryin' On with Johnny Cash and June Carter&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "We all got backstage and said, 'Johnny's not going to make it for maybe two, three more days. We've got to continue on. Or as June would say, "Press on," so here we go,'" remembered Western. "[Saul] said, 'I want everybody stretched. Western, you're going to emcee the show and so forth, but instead of doing fifteen or eighteen minutes, you do at least twenty, twenty-two minutes.' The Statlers were totally capable of doing a bigger show than they had with Johnny, but they were his backup singers and were billed as part of the Johnny Cash Show. Gordon Terry, everybody, stretched and made the whole show go on."&lt;br&gt; In the audience at one of those shows was Bob Wootton, a huge Cash fan who taught himself to play guitar just like Luther Perkins. Short on money, he had saved up for some time to buy tickets and travelled to the Tulsa Civic Centre with his wife and their neighbours. "I paid my good money to see Johnny Cash, and he didn't show up.… But I stayed, you know, they had a guy named Johnny Western, and he did his show, he didn't do Johnny Cash's stuff, and I enjoyed it, but I was just so disappointed. I mean, I had gone to see John one other time and I enjoyed the show, but he came this time to the Coliseum and I thought, 'Hey it's gonna be good.' But he didn't show up," said Wootton.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After the troupe managed to complete four shows, with various cancellations in between, Cash suddenly returned to the tour. "It was at the threatening stage, and I guess they had called and called and called and said, 'Either-or you get straight enough to do these shows or there's going to be lawsuits and it's going to be a very, very serious problem,'" said Western.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The latest string of missed dates was definitely worrying, and not just for the obvious reasons. In the latter part of 1966, Saul had painstakingly orchestrated a lucrative deal with Moeller Talent, a major Nashville-based booking outfit, to act as the exclusive agent for booking the Johnny Cash Show into rodeos and fairs the next summer. At a dead end, with Cash's reputation quickly unravelling, Saul had needed Moeller's help for his summer bookings. The deal was of particular importance because it was essentially negotiated out of sheer desperation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the engagements, organized by agency head and former banker W.E. "Lucky" Moeller himself, was dubbed by Saul to be "not only the largest sum of money to ever be received for an individual C &amp; W performance, but twice as large as any figure previously recorded."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the meantime, unable to find spring work for Cash in the U.S., Saul had resorted to putting up his own money as a promoter and booked him on a seven-show tour of western Canada in April of 1967. However, Johnny would make it only partway through the tour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "We were in Edmonton and he was on a rampage of pep pills, and he had a Martin, an expensive guitar, very expensive guitar," Saul told author Michael Streissguth. "He was in a darkened room, and he hadn't slept for a couple of days, and he's already missed one of the dates. And they're all my dates that I'd set up because nobody wanted to book him. You know, they couldn't trust that he would be there. He took the guitar and smashed it against the wall. I had said things to provoke him. And I guess he just didn't have the nerve to hit me with the guitar so he hit it against the wall and smashed it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article__media"&gt;&lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 25em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 40.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 53.125em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481693686-IMAGE-2.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="article__image-caption"&gt;Saul Holiff and June Carter in the back of a limousine after a show, circa 1962. [Saul Holiff Collection. Photographer unknown.] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the end of the line. This time, it would be Saul who would cancel the remaining dates and simply disappear — an action he would learn to perfect over the years. "I had one of the best disappearing acts," he said. "I just felt that there was a dignity involved and I could only go so far, and when I didn't want to go any further, I just left. I don't think I abandoned him. I think he didn't even know where I was. So yes, I did, but we always got back together."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It wasn't only the buyers who were becoming exasperated with Cash's unreliability. The fans were also beginning to see through the facade of his "laryngitis," "broken ribs," and other myriad excuses. Within two weeks of Saul walking off the job in Canada, the Johnny Cash Show arrived for a gig in Waterloo, Iowa. After Cash immediately passed out in the hotel bed, Marshall and June searched his room and flushed all the pills they could find down the toilet. Together they agreed to let him sleep, hoping a solid twelve hours would do him good, and somehow pulled off the show without him. But the fans, once again, were disappointed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "I was one of the many people who walked out and requested my money back," said audience member Mrs. Ray Kunhtzi, in a letter to the editor following the show. "I really felt very sorry for the rest of the cast. I know they are all capable entertainers, but I also felt justified in asking for a refund. Johnny Cash may be a big name in entertainment, but if he had so little respect for the fans of country music in this town or in any other place he may have failed to appear, then I think he's in the wrong business. I can tell you everyone who asked for their refunds were pretty skeptical about his 'nervous condition.'"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; News soon came in from Lucky Moeller about the extra shows, and it wasn't good. Despite his best efforts, he was able to secure only four summer dates for Johnny. Though they were "very sympathetic to the Johnny Cash situation," he said tactfully, they had become aware of just how much that "situation" affected his ability to sell dates to buyers. "I tried very hard this year to sell Johnny on some of these bigger and better fairs and there was always a doubt in the buyer's mind," Moeller wrote. "They wanted to buy Johnny, but they were afraid that he would not show up at the date."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even as he continued to miss shows, Cash found time to complain about the lack of bookings to Saul, who finally unleashed his mounting frustration. "Moeller has booked only fair dates, as agreed, and after submitting you to every buyer in the business was able to come up with only four dates," Saul said. "Your professional behaviour is totally reprehensible, showing a complete disregard for the rights and feelings of everyone around you."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Of the four dates Moeller had painstakingly managed to secure that summer, Johnny then went on to miss three of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "We did our best to convince (the buyers) that he would be there and of course were let down with these three dates, which not only served as an embarrassing situation for us and no doubt we will be hurt next season by trying to place another package with them as an agent," Moeller said. Though they did not harbour ill feelings toward Cash, they did need to respectfully request their lost commission on the eleven thousand dollars in missed dates, he added. At the Missouri State Fair, a crowd of fourteen thousand had waited in the blazing heat on Sunday evening for "No-Show" Cash. Finally, a local couple, R.C. and JoAnn Holmes, scrambled at the last minute and managed to fill in for him onstage. But the organizers of the Illinois State Fair were angry enough about Cash's absence that they decided to sue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As Saul struggled to mount yet another legal defence on behalf of Cash, the federal government finally launched their own $125,000 lawsuit over the forest fire. And the lawsuit with Stew Carnall continued to rage unsettled. In terms of actual managerial work, as Saul finished up preparations with promoter Mervyn Conn for another major tour of the United Kingdom, he couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. "I am the only booker in show business who sets dates, looks after box office settlements, does all of the surgical repairs on missed dates — which include myriad letters, calls, wires, and meetings, and does it all with the privilege of paying my own costs on the road exclusive of travel. This is unique," he fumed to Johnny. Not only would he now have to arrange for the repayment of Moeller's commission, but he also had to do so knowing he would never receive his own commissions on the shows that Cash blew off. Nor would he be compensated for the days and months of work involved in arranging Cash's divorce, which was now imminent. The final straw came when Cash, beset by financial problems, not only requested that Saul further cut his commission down by 5 percent but also publicly accused him of double-dealing on record sales following a show in Saginaw, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "By confronting me on Sunday night about record sales and suggesting, by innuendo, that I had contrived to cut myself in for a third, you managed to embarrass me, humiliate me, demean me, and discredit me — unnecessarily — in front of everyone in the show, not to mention [promoter] Phil Simon and, of course, those associated with him who would be aware of this episode. It placed me in the position of appearing to conspire for a lousy four or five hundred dollars," Saul wrote. Not only was Cash missing as many dates as he was playing at this point, according to Marshall Grant, but also what money he did make was disappearing just as quickly on lavish purchases. "You missed $40,000 worth of dates within one year, plus the additional reimbursement costs," Saul continued. "At a time when financial pressures existed, you added both the Carter Family and Carl Perkins at an approximate extra cost of $70,000 a year. You committed yourself to a $150,000 home, purchased land, a new Cadillac, a new fence, a new bus, antique furniture [and incurred] interior decorating charges."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Though Saul questioned the logic of Cash seeking to relieve his financial burden by cutting his manager's commission (down to 10 percent after talent was deducted from receipts), Saul agreed to it, on one condition — that Cash curtail his own expenditures and, most important, &lt;i&gt; miss no more dates&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That would be a tall order for Cash, who in an attempt to meet his expenses, had incurred two sizable loans from Columbia Records that totalled $125,000, and had secured the down payment for his new home in Hendersonville only when a Columbia executive acted as guarantor on the loan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even if he cut the unnecessary expenditures completely, the divorce with Vivian would cost him dearly. After his objection to the divorce was withdrawn on August 30, Vivian was eventually granted half of the income from the music Cash had made while they were married, as well as half their assets, the house in Casitas Springs, $1,000 a month in alimony, and $1,600 per month in child support. Cash was also on the hook for her $6,500 attorney's fee. "You should recall that very little has been set aside for 1967 income taxes, and that a sizable amount must yet be raised to meet them," wrote Cash's lawyer Bruce Thompson. "I feel that it would be wise for you to give immediate attention to these financial matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article__media"&gt;&lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 25em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 40.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 53.125em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493481739038-IMAGE-1.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="article__image-caption"&gt;Johnny Cash with a Molson Canadian backstage in London, Ontario, 1958. [Photo courtesy Marilynne Caswell.] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisting in the mire of his life, with chaos pressing in on all sides, Cash was sinking. The haggling over finances with Vivian became heated and at one point boiled over regarding his purchase of a new tour bus for $9,600. He explained to her that they needed the bus to haul not only all the members of their entourage around but their baggage and instruments as well. The plan was to keep it at Marshall's and use it only as a business vehicle. It was also worth noting, he added, its use was for his touring, which in turn generated everyone's living expenses, including the alimony and child support. Johnny explained that the cost of the bus would be taken out of their joint funds over the next three months, which remained joint until the new year, and if she objected to that, the outcome would only negatively affect all of their finances, including hers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was all too much for Cash, who by this point was barely eating. "I didn't want to die, but I'd given up. I'd accepted the fact that I was killing myself, and I was going to try to enjoy it," he acknowledged. Clearly it wasn't an ideal time to kick his habit; the stress of being sober only drove him deeper and deeper into drugs. The love of June Carter was likely the only bright spot in his life, but the drugs were driving her away now, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The struggle to keep Cash alive had become routine for June and Marshall, who mounted an ongoing effort to dispense with Cash's pill supply, chase dealers away, clean up after him, and keep him fed and rested while encouraging him to get clean. But June had finally had enough. Just as it looked like his divorce was to be finalized, she told Johnny that when their current October tour through Michigan and Indiana ended, she was leaving him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The announcement drove him to the brink of madness. One night after a show at the Morris Civic Auditorium in South Bend, Indiana, he turned in desperation to Saul, his "fixer," the man who always seemed capable of combing out even the most tangled messes.

He's a student at CU Boulder, where he's also an RA—so I expect him to have seen lots of crazy stuff. He's also asked to be described as a future billionaire and sex symbol, so here I am respecting his wishes. The other teens I interviewed are Kaitlyn (a former camper of mine) and Deirdre: Kaitlyn is 16 and lives in the suburbs of St. Louis, while Deirdre is 17 and lives in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt; Vodka Eyeballing and Butt Chugging&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first supposed teen trend that I ask Nabil about is called "vodka eyeballing." It's pretty self-explanatory: adults believe that teenagers are using some kind of innovative contraption to pour grain alcohol into their eyeballs to get drunk. Nabil says he has heard of this. "One of my residents told me about it, he said one of his friends tried it," he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I was very surprised to hear this, as I thought I'd be debunking terrifying teen trends—not confirming them. Future billionaire Nabil picked up on my apprehension and started to explain that his school is a "huge frat university" and that they "have a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6TY1SRABes" target="_blank"&gt;asuh&lt;/a&gt; dudes" before shocking me with another bomb: "That same dude started talking about butt chugging."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="article__blockquote"&gt; &lt;i&gt; Literally everyone I know just drinks and smokes weed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For those who aren't frat bros familiar with dangerous drinking trends, butt chugging is when you take a funnel and start chugging alcohol through your butt, which then enters your system faster than traditional consumption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alarmed, I asked Kaitlyn to verify the reality of these heinous acts. She quickly tells me that she doesn't know anyone who has vodka eyeballed or butt chugged. However, she does know girls that have vodka tamponed, which is when one soaks a tampon in vodka and then inserts it in an orifice to get drunk. Kaitlyn describes those who've vodka tamponed as "the super extra ones" at her school, but is certain that this alarming teen trend really does occur.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt; i-Dosing&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt; The next trend is &lt;a href="http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/05/the-10-most-ridiculous-dangerous-teen-trends/i-dosing" target="_blank"&gt;i-dosing&lt;/a&gt;, which is just a fancy name for MP3 drugs, where teens supposedly download tunes crazy enough that listening to them gets you high. This is definitely not a real thing according to Nabil, Deirdre, and Kaitlyn. "Literally everyone I know just drinks and smokes weed," said Kaitlyn, ignoring the fact that she just told me she knows girls who spike their tampons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read the full story at &lt;a href="https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/debunking-alarmist-teen-trends-teenweek"&gt;Broadly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="Sex Roulette to Vodka Eyeballing: Teens on Which Bizarre Trends They Actually Do" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/sex-roulette-to-vodka-eyeballing-teens-on-which-bizarre-trends-they-actually-do" type="text/html"/><link title="Sex Roulette to Vodka Eyeballing: Teens on Which Bizarre Trends They Actually Do" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5904be3057ce532208a431ea/lede/1493483143002-debunking-alarmist-teen-trends-teenweek-1493393251.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Linda Yang</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Linda Yang</id></author><category term="teenagers"/><category term="teens"/><category term="Butt-Chugging"/><category term="Broadly"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-29-16</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-29T16:33:45.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>5904a8564348f421fc6a97ee</id><published>2017-04-29T16:30:35.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-29T16:30:35.000Z</updated><title>Fyre Festival’s 25-Year-Old Organizer: “This Is the Worst Day of My Life”</title><link title="Fyre Festival’s 25-Year-Old Organizer: “This Is the Worst Day of My Life”" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/fyre-festivals-25-year-old-organizer-this-is-the-worst-day-of-my-life" type="text/html"/><link title="Fyre Festival’s 25-Year-Old Organizer: “This Is the Worst Day of My Life”" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5904a8564348f421fc6a97ee/lede/1493477554350-download-8.png" type="image/png"/><author><name>Gabrielle  Bluestone</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Gabrielle  Bluestone</id></author><category term="vice news"/><category term="Instagram"/><category term="bahamas"/><category term="billy mcfarland"/><category term="fyre festival"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-29-16</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-29T16:33:45.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>59024336a1cb6069bbe4feb0</id><published>2017-04-29T15:09:49.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-29T15:09:49.000Z</updated><title>The Five Worst Fake News Stories Trump Has Pushed on America</title><summary type="text">From tapped wires to paid protesters to big-league crowds.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Welcome back to Can't Handle the Truth, our Saturday column looking back at the past seven days of fake news and hoaxes that have spread thanks to the internet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Donald Trump himself has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/855373184861962240" target="_blank"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, this whole first 100 days thing is a "ridiculous standard" for measuring success. He's right, of course: The hundred-day mark, which lands on Saturday, is premised on a meaningless number that humans only care about because the &lt;a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5977095/why-we-should-switch-to-a-base-12-counting-system" target="_blank"&gt;base ten counting system&lt;/a&gt; is rooted in the number of digits a primate has on its hands (exhales). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His first 100 days as president would only be worth mentioning if Trump had ever issued some kind of &lt;a href="https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/_landings/contract/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;signed document&lt;/a&gt; that he referred to as "my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again," featuring &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-promise-tracker/" target="_blank"&gt;60 measurable promises&lt;/a&gt;, or if he had created a "&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/100-days" target="_blank"&gt;First 100 Days&lt;/a&gt;" section on the White House website, touting "bold action to restore prosperity, keep Americans safe and secure, and hold government accountable." If he did those things, trying to diminish the importance of his first 100 days would be disingenuous at best, or dishonest at worst.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Disingenuous at best, or dishonest at worst" is practically Trump's motto, of course, right up there with "&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/" target="_blank"&gt;don't pay contractors&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/oct/08/context-donald-trumps-lewd-remarks-2005/" target="_blank"&gt;I did try and fuck her. She was married.&lt;/a&gt;"  For most of his public life, he's been an unreliable source of information—in fact, he's actually been a pretty &lt;i&gt;reliable&lt;/i&gt; source of &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; information about things with serious consequences. For instance, when talking about his real estate seminar, he said, "&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/20/news/companies/trump_university/" target="_blank"&gt;success. It's going to happen to you&lt;/a&gt;," but that school was &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-university-settlement-20170331-story.html" target="_blank"&gt;actually a scam&lt;/a&gt;. Then there was the time he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/232572505238433794" target="_blank"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that an "'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud." But it wasn't. And this other time, he &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/?utm_term=.85f6e4912927" target="_blank"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that on 9/11, he had "watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down," and that wasn't true either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It's exasperating at times trying to hold Donald Trump to some sort of standard of honesty when A) he doesn't seem to care, and B) he has adopted the term "fake news" and weaponized it against organizations that criticize him. Trump's fake news label occasionally gets slapped on examples of &lt;a href="http://time.com/4645541/donald-trump-white-house-oval-office/" target="_blank"&gt;bias or error that he's right to criticize&lt;/a&gt;. But usually Trump just &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-updates-everything-president-trump-calls-poll-results-fake-1493073219-htmlstory.html" target="_blank"&gt;pulls the term out of his ass&lt;/a&gt; to escape from reality. So as part of the continued effort to push back against that rhetorical slippage, here's some of the actual fake news Trump has unleashed on the world during the 100 days he's been President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;del&gt;His inaugural crowd was the biggest ever&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 550px;" data-iframely-id="L2S4cry" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/L2S4cry?app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's not much left to say about this. Trump &lt;a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Trump-Inauguration-Crowd-Estimates-410559995.html" target="_blank"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; "unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout" at his inauguration. The odds were always against that, given that Trump lost the popular vote and the inauguration was being held in deep-blue Washington DC, far away from most of his supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that the timing of the viral photos that circulated on inauguration day may have made for Twitter-friendly sight gags that overstated the difference in attendance, but that doesn't change the fact that all available &lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/21/sean-spicer/trump-had-biggest-inaugural-crowd-ever-metrics-don/" target="_blank"&gt;metrics&lt;/a&gt; say Trump's crowd was smaller than Obama's in 2009. Still, Trump could have just moved on, and crossed "biggest inauguration audience ever" off the list of possible human achievements he can claim—getting elected president at all is pretty good on its own, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Instead, at the first White House press conference of Trump's young presidency, his shiny new press secretary, Sean Spicer, had to devote much of his time at the podium to &lt;a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/sean-spicers-uses-first-white-house-presser-to-blast-media-over-shameful-reports-on-crowd-sizes/" target="_blank"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that Trump's had been "the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period." Then, when that was quickly debunked, Spicer spent days refining his attempt to wrongly paint the Trump inauguration as the most-watched of all time, &lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/21/sean-spicer/trump-had-biggest-inaugural-crowd-ever-metrics-don/" target="_blank"&gt;mostly by cherry-picking data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 23, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway gave a jaw-dropping interview to Chuck Todd saying team Trump hadn't been providing falsehoods, but "&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;alternative facts&lt;/a&gt;." Conway's Orwellian slip of the tongue was a fitting kickoff to life in Trump's America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;del&gt;There was significant voter fraud during the election&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 550px;" data-iframely-id="Mpga635" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/Mpga635?app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 23, Trump revived an idea he first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fthe-fix%2Fwp%2F2016%2F11%2F27%2Fdonald-trump-i-won-the-popular-vote-if-you-deduct-the-millions-of-people-who-voted-illegally%2F" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted shortly after the election&lt;/a&gt;: that his election win would have been even winnier if millions of people hadn't voted illegally. In a private meeting with Congressional leadership, he "claimed without evidence"—newspaper-speak for "probably a lie"—that &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/315791-trump-told-leaders-illegals-cost-him-popular-vote" target="_blank"&gt;3 to 5 million undocumented immigrants&lt;/a&gt; had cost him the popular vote. Two days later, Trump tweeted that he would try and devote government resources to investigating voter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/washington/12fraud.html" target="_blank"&gt;many years&lt;/a&gt; now, &lt;a href="http://www.wnd.com/2017/04/state-refuses-vote-fraud-probe-snubs-video-evidence/" target="_blank"&gt;right-wing activists&lt;/a&gt; have spent a great deal of time trying to prove the assertion that voter fraud is a massive problem in the US. You, the person reading this, may be part of the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/15/poll-nearly-half-of-americans-say-voter-fraud-occurs-often/?utm_term=.335cdb8df4bf" target="_blank"&gt;almost half of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who believe in their hearts that election fraud is a problem in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revived right-wing fury over fraud at the polls led to new crackdowns on voter fraud, like &lt;a href="https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2017/04/26/arizona-house-passes-sb1370-to-restore-ability-to-prosecute-double-voting/" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona's&lt;/a&gt;. And there are new voter ID laws now, like the one in &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/13/contentious-voter-id-bill-gets-final-ok-heads-branstad/100416752/" target="_blank"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But did Trump's actual investigation reveal widespread fraud, leading to his humiliating popular vote defeat by Hillary Clinton? No one knows, because that investigation &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/21/politics/donald-trump-voter-fraud-mike-pence/" target="_blank"&gt;never happened&lt;/a&gt;. But state-wide investigations have turned up &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/18/us/voter-fraud.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=B2D15F4C51BF8CB3C58FCF7624DE5470&amp;gwt=pay" target="_blank"&gt;nearly no fraud&lt;/a&gt;—just dozens, or possibly hundreds of instances. In an election involving almost 140 million ballots, that's pretty slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;del&gt;Sinister liberal imposters have been infiltrating town halls in red districts&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 550px;" data-iframely-id="XnEj7H9" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/XnEj7H9?app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Trump's February 21 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/834181712783560705" target="_blank"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; is sorta right: Liberal groups were very much part of a groundswell of anti-Trump fury directed at lawmakers in &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/318175-republican-lawmakers-face-rising-anger-at-town-halls" target="_blank"&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; when they held events in their home districts. But calling them "so-called angry crowds" paints them as insincere. And saying the events are "planned out" makes them sound underhanded. When the conservative media ran with the story, it became a minor conspiracy theory: Liberal "&lt;a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/21/protesters-republican-town-hall-meetings-are-liber/" target="_blank"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt;" were ostensibly showing up and conducting a misinformation campaign at what should have been conservative town halls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican lawmakers, mind you, are supposed represent their entire constituencies, not just the people who voted for them. So when a group like the &lt;a href="http://dailycallernewsfoundation.org/2017/03/18/watch-gop-congressman-booed-by-leftist-activists-after-vowing-to-support-more-funding-for-u-s-military/" target="_blank"&gt;Michigan People's Campaign&lt;/a&gt; shows up to express anti-Trump sentiment at an event in Detroit held by a Republican representative, that's not an evil campaign of misinformation from George Soros. That's just what democracy looks like (sorry). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;del&gt;People are being paid to protest Trump&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 550px;" data-iframely-id="7OZ6G8I" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/7OZ6G8I?app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, Trump would have you believe the protesters who showed up on tax day to demand his tax returns were "paid for." This goes back to something Trump told &lt;i&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/i&gt;in November about the people at anti-Trump demonstrations being "&lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-donald-trump-family-melania-ivanka-lesley-stahl/" target="_blank"&gt;professional protesters&lt;/a&gt;." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a popular accusation in Conspiracy Land. &lt;a href="https://www.infowars.com/proof-the-trump-protests-utilizing-paid-professional-protesters-financed-by-george-soros/" target="_blank"&gt;A post on Infowars&lt;/a&gt; for instance, claims to have "proof" that anti-Trump protesters have been "utilizing paid protesters financed by George Soros." What it actually shows is that a liberal organization is hiring organizers. It's normal for an organization—the National Right to Life, for instance—to &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00111278" target="_blank"&gt;fundraise&lt;/a&gt;, and then use that money to organize a demonstration—the &lt;a href="http://marchforlife.org/" target="_blank"&gt;March for Life&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. It doesn't mean the people participating in a demonstration don't believe the stuff on their signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrator of the video embedded in the Infowars post wants to know why Hillary Clinton won't "command her SJWs to stop protesting" now that she's lost. To Trump and his fans, it's taken as an article of faith that no one would, in their heart of hearts, dislike Trump's policies enough to protest for free. This type of astroturfing is probably familiar to Trump, who appears to have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/23/this-is-how-donald-trump-engineers-applause/?utm_term=.1db46811df03" target="_blank"&gt;planted supporters&lt;/a&gt; at presidential speaking engagements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Elections Commission investigated Trump for paying actors to cheer at a campaign event in 2015, but they stopped investigating the matter because, not because the accusation was false, necessarily, but because Trump isn't alleged to have spent &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/donald-trump-campaign-announcement-actors-fec" target="_blank"&gt;very much money&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;del&gt;Obama wiretapped Trump's Campaign &lt;/del&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 550px;" data-iframely-id="kC4FRZM" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/kC4FRZM?app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Trump tweeted on March 4 that President Obama had his "'wires tapped' in Trump Tower" during the campaign, the Trump administration and other officials bent over backwards trying to retcon Trump's assertion into something true. Or if it couldn't be "true," something adjacent to a concept with a drop of truth in it. Or if it couldn't be a drop of "truth" per se, a drop of truth-flavored falsehood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBI director James Comey almost immediately &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/us/politics/trump-seeks-inquiry-into-allegations-that-obama-tapped-his-phones.html" target="_blank"&gt;asked the Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; to refute Trump's accusation. So then Conway tried to backpedal away from the whole idea of wiretapping—the surveillance state has many tools, she said, including &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-more-than-just-spying-microwaves-why-1489416182-htmlstory.html" target="_blank"&gt;smart microwaves&lt;/a&gt;. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, concluded that there'd been no wiretap. Then Trump himself &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-wiretapping-phone-new-york-times-trump-tower-us-election-a7632631.html" target="_blank"&gt;walked back the claim&lt;/a&gt; that there'd been a wiretap, pointing out that "wires tapped" was in quotes in the tweet, whatever that means. Then Spicer quoted Fox News talking head "Judge" Andrew Napolitano, who said the surveillance was carried out by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/16/sean-spicer-just-suggested-that-obama-used-british-intelligence-to-spy-on-trump-not-so-much/?utm_term=.9455491bb9db" target="_blank"&gt;British intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, but the British called that claim "utterly ridiculous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee received a tip from a source that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/devin-nunes-intelligence-reports.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=B56C2A8B0E0F0FA1924A7E732E7A80E3&amp;gwt=pay" target="_blank"&gt;appears to have been the White House itself&lt;/a&gt; telling him that the deep state had conducted surveillance on members of the Trump transition team (though &lt;i&gt;not his campaign) &lt;/i&gt;when they were communicating with targets of surveillance overseas. But there's nothing startling about that if you know how the US surveillance state works. "What would truly be 'startling,'" wrote &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/22/congressmans-trump-surveillance-claims-have-an-obvious-mundane-explanation/" target="_blank"&gt;Jon Schwarz of the Intercept&lt;/a&gt;, "would be if the US intelligence apparatus &lt;i&gt; hadn't&lt;/i&gt; picked up many Trump staffers speaking with foreign targets of surveillance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Trump's claim that "Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory" was not true, or based on anything remotely true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the effort more or less succeeded, since, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/343392363/Cbs-Poll-7am-Toplines" target="_blank"&gt;CBS poll&lt;/a&gt;, 74 percent of Republicans believe Trump's utterly false claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Mike Pearl on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mikeleepearl" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="The Five Worst Fake News Stories Trump Has Pushed on America" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-five-worst-fake-news-stories-trump-has-pushed-on-america" type="text/html"/><link title="The Five Worst Fake News Stories Trump Has Pushed on America" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/59024336a1cb6069bbe4feb0/lede/1493416840581-Trump_Fake_News4.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Mike Pearl</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Mike Pearl</id></author><category term="politics"/><category term="Donald Trump"/><category term="lies"/><category term="fake news"/><category term="hoaxes"/><category term="wiretapping"/><category term="Can't Handle the Truth"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-29-15</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-29T15:11:33.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>590371d74348f421fc6a91cf</id><published>2017-04-29T13:23:33.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-29T13:23:33.000Z</updated><title>Trump Voters Explain Why He's Doing Great, Actually</title><summary type="text">"He's pissing off everybody with his big brass balls."</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media wants you to believe Trump's first 100 days in office have been a disaster. Courts have repeatedly blocked his immigration executive orders, using &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/10/donald-trump-appeals-court-tweets-travel-ban/" target="_blank"&gt;his own tweets as evidence&lt;/a&gt; that he wanted to instate a Muslim ban. His first attempt at repealing and replacing Obamacare was a comedy of errors. He's &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/04/trump-flip-flop-foreign-policy-tpp-russia-ukraine-sudan-japan-china/523008/" target="_blank"&gt;flip-flopped&lt;/a&gt; on many of his foreign policy stances, recently &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-nafta-partners-persuaded-him-to-keep-u-s-in-trade-pact-1493320127" target="_blank"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;, "Hey, I'm a nationalist and a globalist." This week he even admitted to Reuters that he thought the job of president would be &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/trump-surprised-being-president-is-harder-than-the-apprentice"&gt;easier than it is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But most of that sort of analysis of Trump's first 100 days is written by people who didn't want him to be president to begin with—a category that includes me. So I reached out to a variety of Trump voters to see how they saw his presidency. (Since supporting Trump can be controversial in various workplaces and communities, several subjects asked not to be identified by their full names.) Here's what they told me:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mo, a fifty-something healthcare professional in Tennessee&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VICE: Which of Trump's campaign platforms are most important to you? Do you think he's made good on them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mo: &lt;/b&gt;Trump provided a list of over 20 names that he said he would choose from for the Supreme Court. He kept that promise. He has more than three and a half years to go in this term. I think the big government status quo mindset of politicians, including Republicans, are holding him back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something this administration did that I am very thankful for is the &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/04/genital-cutting-indian-doctor-women-khatna" target="_blank"&gt;first-ever arrest&lt;/a&gt; for female genital cutting. The physician involved is believed to have been doing this since 2004. The law has been on the books since 1996. But it is the Trump administration when the first arrest is made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; What's the most important thing you want Trump to accomplish in his presidency?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Another conservative, constitutional Supreme Court justice appointment...or two. Plus more conservative justices in the lower courts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; As a healthcare professional, what do you make of his healthcare policy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;I don't fully know Trump's healthcare policy. I don't know if he fully knows it since what should be done and what can be done is not yet settled. I agree that ACA needs to go. It is already in the insurance death spiral that was predicted years ago by its earliest critics. People are insulated from the true cost of healthcare by health insurance and health prices are inflated to pay for those who receive care but do not/can not pay for it. Healthcare is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a right. We have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have a right to the goods and services of others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Have any of Trump's decisions in the first 100 days made you disillusioned with his presidency?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;No. I do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; regret at all that Hillary [Clinton] is not our president.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chris, a 23-year-old bank teller in Vermont&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VICE: Why did you vote for Trump?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris: &lt;/b&gt;I voted for Trump to weaken the moderate left. After the primary, the mood was that Hillary was going to easily win office. A Clinton victory would have set back the left wing of the Democratic Party for years, at the very least until 2020. Having won both the primary and the general election by wide margins, the party establishment would have had an excuse to sweep Bernie [Sanders]'s "revolution" under the rug, never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; How do you feel about the mass protests against Trump?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;They're a little too focused on social justice for my taste. Don't get me wrong, those issues are important, but the whole point of making sure Hillary lost was to promote socialism. The Democratic Party already has a solid set of positions on things like minority rights, women's rights, and abortion. Where's the march for healthcare, or Occupy Wall Street part two?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Which of Trump's campaign platforms are most important to you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Infrastructure. That's one of the few issues where he and the left overlap, and I'm hoping his own party won't derail his planned infrastructure bill when it comes up for a vote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, healthcare. The ACA made Democrats complacent. If Trump destroys healthcare then single-payer will grow in popularity. You can already see polls where support for it is over 50 percent just from the THREAT of the GOP messing with the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; What do you make of the president's use of Twitter?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"Weaponized Shitposting," the #1 tool of the Australian army and Internet Trolls everywhere. A lot of people underestimate what Trump accomplished by winning over the "Alt-Right" and generally gaining a huge internet following.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; April 29 marks Trump's 100th day in office. Do you think he's met his campaign promises? Do you believe he will?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;He absolutely has not, and he won't, because he's being held back by his own indifference. All indications so far are that Trump finds actual governance to be boring and he leaves most of the work to rival factions of advisors, many of whom are in the political establishment and don't care about his "agenda."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Spencer Raitt-Forrest, a 23-year-old operating supervisor in New York City&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;VICE: Do you think Trump has met his campaign promises?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spencer Raitt-Forrest: &lt;/b&gt;I think he's met more campaign promises than pretty much any other president in recent history. He is trying his best, I think his healthcare reform is garbage, and that's why it didn't pass. I'm happy the first round didn't pass. But if you ever read &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Deal&lt;/i&gt;, that's all according to plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Have any of Trump's decisions in the first 100 days made you disillusioned with his presidency?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No. With exception of his fair trade policy, history shows that this will not work. [Herbert] Hoover tried it, he failed miserably.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Has Donald Trump's presidency thus far made you confident that he will make America great again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;I personally think America was always great. He has done a lot to reduce regulation on business, and as one who has studied economics in depth believe that any barriers of entry that are reduced are for the betterment of the economy. He's fulfilled the promises he could without Congress, and is working towards solutions for the ones he has not met. 100 days is really only a little over three months, that isn't much time at all considering the vast history and governance of the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jonathan, a 35-year-old insurance agent from Missississippi&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VICE: Do you think Trump has met his campaign promises?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jonathan: &lt;/b&gt;I would need a refresh on the promises. I'm sure there are more than 100. But so far, I think he's doing as well as I expected. He's pissing off everybody with his big brass balls and the economic numbers and the fact that Kim Jong Un is thinking twice about starting some shit is pretty great.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Do you think the press has covered Donald Trump dishonestly? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The press is doing exactly what he wants. He gives them stuff to talk about. His incompetence, his hair, his lack of regard for pomp and manners. I'm almost certain some coverage of it is dishonest. He's went out of his way to piss them all off. They are angry and when you can make someone angry you have (at least a little) control over them. Which is more than he had 98 days ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Have any of Trump's decisions in the first 100 days made you disillusioned with his presidency?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The whole Russian thing bothers me more than anything. Everything I've seen makes it look systemic. I came up with a theory that after failing at business ventures for years, he borrowed some Russian funds and now he's just trying to clear the debt before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; What's the most important thing you want Trump to accomplish in his presidency?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;I want socialized healthcare because my divorce dictates that I'm responsible for my kids' medical expenses. I want him to call the Democrats' bluff on the government shutdown. I want him to fix all the military cuts Obama made. And I want him to campaign on the wall platform in 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; The GOP healthcare plan is more or less the opposite of socialized healthcare—people on the left like Bernie Sanders are actually the ones advocating for that. Trump's healthcare plan would make healthcare way, way more expensive and give people less government subsidies. Were you aware of that? Does that change the way you understand Trump? Did you think he would socialize healthcare?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Nah, he won't socialize healthcare. I never thought he would. I would like it though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jason, a 32-year-old digital marketer in Oregon&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VICE: Which of Trump's campaign platforms are most important to you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jason: &lt;/b&gt;The biggest issues for me were staying out of the Middle East—Hillary wanted a no fly zone over Syria—and getting rid of judicial activists and putting originalists on the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have any of Trump's decisions in the first 100 days made you disillusioned with his presidency?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two biggest things are Syria and Obamacare. He campaigned on ending nation-building, he can't get involved in regime change in Syria. Obamacare is what flipped me from a Democrat to whatever I am now, so seeing Trump screw it up is disappointing. He needs to either leave it alone until it collapses and forces Democrats to give them votes, or repeal it outright and force Democrats to give them votes. The "let's try to get as much through reconciliation as we can" plan is stupid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's the most important thing you want Trump to accomplish in his presidency?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not use our military to force regime change in Syria or any other country. No foreign wars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Has Donald Trump's presidency thus far made you confident that he will make America great again?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not trust Trump. His actions on immigration, regulatory reform, DAPL/KeystoneXL, Gorsuch and his tax proposal have given me a small amount of hope that maybe by 2020 I will trust him. I never bought into any of the MAGA stuff, so I can't speak to that. What I can say is that I have absolutely no regrets voting for him over Hillary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; These interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Eve Peyser on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/evepeyser" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="Trump Voters Explain Why He's Doing Great, Actually" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/trump-voters-explain-why-hes-doing-great-actually" type="text/html"/><link title="Trump Voters Explain Why He's Doing Great, Actually" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/590371d74348f421fc6a91cf/lede/1493413871580-100daysoftrump.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Eve Peyser</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Eve Peyser</id></author><category term="politics"/><category term="healthcare"/><category term="Donald Trump"/><category term="trump voters"/><category term="100 days"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-29-13</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-29T13:28:03.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>5903be3857ce532208a430a0</id><published>2017-04-29T05:00:00.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-29T05:00:00.000Z</updated><title>Tonight's 'Drag Race' Eliminee Says She'll Be Back</title><summary type="text">And tells us about the cultural barriers that may have contributed to her elimination.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt; Last season on &lt;i&gt; RuPaul's Drag Race,&lt;/i&gt; we were introduced to the bombastic Puerto Rican queen Cynthia Lee Fontaine, the queen who is seemingly incapable of going five minutes without making &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYlACzrxvm0" target="_blank"&gt;a joke about her "cucu."&lt;/a&gt; Always peppy, caring, and able to get a laugh with her twisted English, Cynthia was a fan favorite. She was sent packing just three episodes in, however, after daring to grace the runway with what may amount to the &lt;a href="http://ew.com/tv/2017/04/01/rupauls-drag-race-season-9-returning-queen-cynthia-lee-fontaine/" target="_blank"&gt;ugliest pair of gym shorts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt; Drag Race&lt;/i&gt; history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then, after her elimination, she received incredibly awful news: a diagnosis of &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/entertainment/tv/article/Cynthia-Lee-Fontaine-gets-revealing-after-Drag-6992595.php" target="_blank"&gt;stage 1 liver cancer.&lt;/a&gt; After beating it earlier this year, Ru decided to give her a second chance at the race, bringing her back as this season's surprise 14th queen.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But she couldn't quite turn her revival into a renaissance. In tonight's episode, her appearance as Sofia Vergara in the show's storied &lt;i&gt; Snatch Game &lt;/i&gt;(in which contestants are challenged to deliver their best celebrity impressions) seemed poorly planned and wasn't funny at all. This episode, she made her second foray thus far into the bottom two—and while she was saved last week by &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/eurekas-getting-workqueens-compensation-from-rupauls-drag-race"&gt;Eureka's sudden departure&lt;/a&gt; due to a torn ACL, this week saw her lip sync for her life against Peppermint, a veritable lip sync professional. Cynthia didn't stand a chance, and ultimately, she sashayed away. She will be missed, but &lt;i&gt; some&lt;/i&gt; of us could do without ever hearing the word "cucu" ever again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; VICE: How do you think you're going to feel after watching your second elimination this week?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt; Cynthia Lee Fontaine: &lt;/b&gt;To be very honest with you, I don't know. I put in a lot of effort and enthusiasm on Snatch Game, so hopefully people get to see my energy. This season I'm so happy, because the entire season, I was constantly one of the top three characters they mentioned. The promotion and exposure on season nine, for me, has just been fantastic. I'm very pleased and excited, even if I'm gonna be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; How was season nine different for you than season eight?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Season eight I was kind of lost because it was something new for me. So on season nine, I was like oh, I'm a pro, you know? I've got the experience, so I know how this goes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; You finally made it to the Snatch Game this time—were you excited to get to do your character?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Extremely. And let me tell you why—because I like to do impersonations. In the Latino American community, in drag, you do impersonations. On the show, in bars, in venues or whatever. I was so excited for my character, because she's Latina and very fun—I'm related to Sophia Vergara because I've been doing her for like a year and a half or two years. And I love to do characters, I love acting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; If you've been doing her for a year, why didn't people think your impression was better than it was?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's choices, like Tatiana says. The show appreciates a performer or a contestant that appreciates pop culture history. And if you see in the past, there's just only like two or three characters with modern personalities, like Britney Spears. But the winners for Snatch Games are like, great performers from the past, you know? Actresses, faces from the past. And I think the show, and especially mama RuPaul, was looking for a character from the past that she loved, that influenced her history, to become the supermodel of the world. So maybe that's why my character—a fresh character—maybe probably didn't step out to the game on the Snatch Game. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Your lip syncing has been criticized a couple of times this season. Do you think it's harder for you because of the language barrier? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; I don't think it's a language barrier—it's about accent, you know? My first lip sync for my life, I got criticized because people said "you don't know the words." It's not about that—it's the way that I do the pronunciation, to exaggerate the sentences or subjects or predicates in the lyrics. That happens to a lot of Latino girls working in the drag community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; There are often Puerto Rican drag queens on &lt;i&gt;Drag Race&lt;/i&gt; but no one has ever won. Why do you think that is?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; I think the drag community in Latin America and Puerto Rico, generally, is a bit different than here in the USA. Here in US, they look for a complete package—as an actress, singer, you know. In our country it's about, look—yes, it's about performance, because the venues in our country are only bars and nightclubs. But here in America you've got an opportunity to act, to sing. Here you get the opportunity to other stuff in the performing arts as a drag queen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Don't take me wrong, we have great, great, complete package drag queens in our Latin American countries. But when you go to &lt;i&gt; Drag Race &lt;/i&gt;and start filming, you do not expect the impact of "oh, I've got to do another thing, besides look and lip sync and dancing." You know what I mean? So I think it's a shock, and just adapting ourselves to go in that environment and expect to do all the performing arts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; We learned on this season that you battled cancer.

"One way I love integrating is swimming." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a Monday night and there's about ten of us sitting on floor pillows in a circle around Godasi, who is from Israel and wears her long auburn hair in two tight French braids. Godasi is what's known as a psychedelic integration coach, and the bi-monthly, donation-based meetings she leads are intended to provide support and guidance after a psychedelic trip induced by hallucinogenic substances. The aim, she says, is to offer a space for thoughtful integration—or the mental processing of a psychedelic experience long after the effects of a drug have worn off. It's an aspect of psychedelic experimentation that's often overlooked in mainstream culture, but that devotees say is equally as important (if not more important) than the trip itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of integration has been around in some form or another for nearly as long as people have been seeking enlightenment through mind-altering substances. Modern enthusiasts trace the practice back &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f2iVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=ancient+amazon+ayahuasca+integration&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZqP67ZeXZO&amp;sig=ZxAru2wd03XZYM5uog2_juaIpJ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgjabw2sfTAhUqsVQKHXM_CLAQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20amazon%20ayahuasca%20integration&amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of years&lt;/a&gt; to Amazonian as well as Native American tribes who took psychedelics in ceremonial settings in search of enlightenment. But in Western medicine, it wasn't until the 1960s that integration became a tenet of the psychedelic therapy movement, pioneered by radical California psychologists like Leo Zeff, a Jungian therapist who saw psychedelics as a &lt;a href="http://www.maps.org/images/pdf/books/scr/scr.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;tool for self-improvement&lt;/a&gt;, and James Fadiman, who co-founded the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in Palo Alto in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But only recently have coaches, therapists, and healers begun to advertise these services more widely and to the general public. Godasi is one of just a handful of psychedelic integration coaches that openly practices in Los Angeles, but groups like hers have started forming in cities across the country. The rise of so-called integration circles coincides with what many practitioners are calling a psychedelic renaissance, signaled by a new wave of &lt;a href="https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/psychedelic-drugs-really-do-lead-to-a-higher-state-of-consciousness"&gt;academic research&lt;/a&gt; into the possible medicinal benefits of substances like psilocybin (the psychoactive ingredient in mushrooms) and MDMA. Godasi and those who seek her services hope that these above ground meetings will help legitimize psychedelics as real forms of medicine and therapy, rather than just party drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The field is so new and it's so needed because everyone knows people who drop acid or who roll on molly—right, most of us do—and these people are experimenting with in fact what are considered extremely powerful substances and medicine," Godasi told me in a phone interview. "Why is there a medical system to assist people who take Advil or overdose on sleeping pills, but not one to help someone who felt like they met their own god or became completely in love with their friend while taking MDMA?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Godasi today considers herself something of an expert on psychedelics, then it was only recently that she was still taking substances "kind of mindlessly," she says. Then an experience at Coachella three years ago shifted her whole point of view. "I took a huge dose of MDMA that completely changed my life and it was hard to get back into this world, you know, with everything that I understand now," she recalls. "All of the new and incredible universal knowledge and downloads that I received and understandings about the nature of humanity" left her crying the whole drive home, she says. But she had no idea what to make of this experience or how to integrate it into her everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until the following year that she discovered integration during a psychedelic conference in LA called Visionary Convergence. The idea behind it, presented in a lecture by Berkeley-based clinical psychologist Susana Bustos, immediately clicked with Godasi. But when she and her friend Ashley Booth—the founder of the LA-based psychedelic advocacy group &lt;a href="https://awareproject.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Aware Project&lt;/a&gt;—noticed there were few places in the city that offered integration support, they launched their own last year. The result is an organization called InnerSpace Integration, which laid the groundwork for Godasi's integration circles (she has since branched off and now leads them under her own independent brand). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of prohibition, people don't have the kind of support and education to be able to make good decisions about usage," says Booth, who adds that those who go on ayahuasca retreats in Peru, for example, where it's legal, sometimes arrive home to find there's nobody else to talk about their experiences with. "We really would like to create these sort of gathering spaces for people to be able to continue to talk about their experience and how their integration process is unfolding," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most psychedelics are still Schedule I drugs, with LSD, MDMA, and Psilocybin listed in the same category for abuse as heroin. Which is why Godassi begins every integration circle with a legal disclaimer: She is in no way encouraging anyone to procure or ingest illegal substances. She also instructs the group to avoid naming any medicine providers—a preferred term in this community for what others might think of as drug dealers—or disclosing the locations where we may have taken hallucinogenic substances like ayahuasca, which in the United States is often administered illegally during group ceremonies in private homes or other underground venues. There's always a chance there could be undercover cops in the room, Godassi says, before alerting everyone to my presence as a journalist. (The members of the group have asked to remain anonymous in this article, many citing potential professional repercussions as a result of their use of psychedelics). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration circle is mostly self-directed, and Godasi says she prefers to sit back and observe rather than guiding the conversation. (She also leads one-on-one sessions that tend to be more intensive.) But getting the group to talk isn't always easy, and even though everyone is presumably here to get something off their chests, the room is frequently punctuated by awkward silences. Godasi scans the room, making eye contact and gently posing open-ended questions to find out who recently had a psychedelic experience they're struggling to make sense of. Once the group finally does start to open up, their anecdotes are sometimes prefaced with notes of caution that they've never told it to anyone before. When one person says he no longer relates to his friends after having done ayahuasca, Godasi jumps in with supportive questions intended to provoke dialgoue. "Our entire life revolves around relationships," she says. "So how do you come back and talk to people?" Think of the experience, she says, as "an invitation to reassess where you are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"James," a 50-year-old IT recruiter who asked me not to use his real name, is one of the group's more regular members. He says he experimented with psychedelics recreationally when he was in his teens and 20s, but after getting hooked on methamphetamines, he quit drugs altogether and got sober. "I moved away from the area I was in, I just changed my life and led a suburban life for 20 years," he says. "And a couple years ago my life got shaken up and I started looking for myself again." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when he turned to psychedelics—and this time he wasn't just looking to get high. He'd been seeing a psychotherapist for a while, he says, but it wasn't until he started tripping on ayahuasca and DMT that he started to have a breakthrough about who he really was and how to be himself—especially at work, where he felt like he was always pretending to be a more likable, corporate version of himself. "That process of becoming more at ease with myself, becoming less inhibited, being more comfortable with my own skin, all of those things have been helped immensely by psychedelics," he says, cautioning that while his own experiences have been positive, psychedelics aren't for everybody, nor does he advocate that they'll help anyone else in the same way. "That's where the practice of integration comes in because you learn things about yourself but you have to figure out what those things mean to you and how to integrate them into your life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not as if he can tell his colleagues and clients about the time he hallucinated that humanoids told him the meaning of life during a DMT trip. Those are the kinds of stories he saves for Godasi's integration circle, where it's not uncommon to hear from people who say they spoke to God, saw the afterlife, or communicated with the spirits of deceased loved ones during a psychedelic trip. These are the types of anecdotes that Godasi says could get a person diagnosed with psychosis or mania if they were to tell a doctor or a therapist about them—instead, she says, most people choose to keep quiet. Others, like James, seek out an integration coach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 90 minute integration circle comes to a close, Godasi presses her palms together in prayer and bows her head down, thanking us all for coming and for sharing our experiences. Most of us just met each other tonight, but nobody is ready to leave yet. We all stand in a circle making small talk, and James asks another member of the group where her accent is from. She says she believes she may have inherited it from a past life. Then, as well all linger in the room, she says she can feel that maybe our spirits have exited our bodies and are now communicating telepathically with one another. Everyone stares at each other in silence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="The Support Groups that Help People Process Psychedelic Trips" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-support-groups-that-help-people-process-psychedelic-trips" type="text/html"/><link title="The Support Groups that Help People Process Psychedelic Trips" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/58fe61d7fce2b266116eb406/lede/1493314588372-TRIPPY_SUPPORT_GROUP.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Jennifer Swann</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Jennifer Swann</id></author><category term="drugs"/><category term="mental health"/><category term="Los Angeles"/><category term="dmt"/><category term="MDMA"/><category term="acid"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-28-22</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-28T22:19:40.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>5903b55f63ad5d1434aa52e2</id><published>2017-04-28T21:50:00.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-28T21:50:00.000Z</updated><title>Trump's Next 100 Days Won't Be Any Better</title><summary type="text">Can he grow into the presidency?

The White House has tried to sell (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-scrambles-to-show-progress-as-the-100-day-mark-approaches/2017/04/25/9fc6803c-29d4-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.html?utm_term=.dab07b6e834e" target="_blank"&gt;via error-laden lists&lt;/a&gt;) Trump's &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/trump-executive-orders/" target="_blank"&gt;prolific use&lt;/a&gt; of executive actions as proof of profound productivity, and Trump&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/24/politics/donald-trump-first-100-days-plans/" target="_blank"&gt; has tried to undermine&lt;/a&gt; the 100-day yardstick&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/26/gettysburg-speech-trump-made-100-days-promises-did-he-keep-them/100571722/" target="_blank"&gt; he himself highlighted&lt;/a&gt; on the campaign trail. But there's no denying that Trump hasn't delivered on many of his firm promises to voters so far: Aside from putting Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and cracking down on undocumented immigrants, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/26/gettysburg-speech-trump-made-100-days-promises-did-he-keep-them/100571722/" target="_blank"&gt;most of his actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-scrambles-to-show-progress-as-the-100-day-mark-approaches/2017/04/25/9fc6803c-29d4-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.html?utm_term=.dab07b6e834e" target="_blank"&gt; have&lt;/a&gt; proven to be more showmanship than substance. Trump's&lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/26/trump-first-100-days-president-rating-accomplishments-215071" target="_blank"&gt; wild accusations and erratic behavior&lt;/a&gt; may have already damaged the institution of the American presidency. And as I write this, &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/331009-schumer-blocks-one-week-stopgap-funding-bill" target="_blank"&gt;it seems he'll barely avoid&lt;/a&gt; a government shutdown (by letting Congress extend negotiations for another week) that &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/trump-is-the-wild-card-who-could-force-a-government-shutdown-next-week"&gt;there was no need to fly this close to&lt;/a&gt; on his first miniscule funding battle. The list of Trump's failures is so long—we haven't even scratched the surface here—that presidential historian &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/specials/donald-trump-first-100-days" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Alter recently told NBC News&lt;/a&gt; "this is the worst, least successful, first 100 days since it became a concept in 1933." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But other presidents, &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/20/trump-first-100-days-year-presidency-215040" target="_blank"&gt;notably Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, have had disastrous first 100 days and recovered. Trump's advisers seem confident they're &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-scrambles-to-show-progress-as-the-100-day-mark-approaches/2017/04/25/9fc6803c-29d4-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.html?utm_term=.dab07b6e834e" target="_blank"&gt;coming to grips with the slow pace of&lt;/a&gt; the legislative process, and his supporters still back him. It's possible his next 100 days will be better than this stretch, at least when it comes to his legislative agenda. Given where he is on his apparently steep learning curve at day 99, though, that seems unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 3944px;" data-iframely-id="XAwKAy" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.3469%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/XAwKAy?summary=true&amp;app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over the past few days, a media narrative has emerged that Trump has come to grips with the fact that a president is not a CEO or a reality TV show host who can clap his hands and get things done. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/04/26/this-is-why-trumps-legislative-agenda-is-stuck-in-neutral/?utm_term=.1f897d7ac644" target="_blank"&gt;Recognizing the complexities of Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/donald-trump-health-care-100-days/" target="_blank"&gt; and his initial failures&lt;/a&gt;, this interpretation goes, Trump has started to develop a subtler mode of operating. Case in point, soon after the implosion of the Republican Affordable Care Act replacement bill in the House last month, &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/26/trump-obamacare-repeal-replace-237654" target="_blank"&gt;Trump reportedly quietly revived it&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to take lead on a softer and more open-ended approach. The result was a negotiated compromise &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/new-republican-health-care-bill-exempts-congress-cut-obamacare-590355" target="_blank"&gt;bill with buy-in&lt;/a&gt; from conservative Republicans and at least one moderate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The one-page sketch of a tax reform plan Trump released this Wednesday also read to some as&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-25/trump-changing-tactics-on-tax-after-health-care-repeal-failure" target="_blank"&gt; a sign of growth&lt;/a&gt;. It was the White House taking point on a priority, but it also &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/26/donald-trump-tax-plan-steve-mnuchin/100923518/" target="_blank"&gt;offered legislators basic principles&lt;/a&gt; to build upon rather than trying to stuff a fully-formed bill down legislators' throats, as in the case of the initial ACA replacement bill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "It is a step in the right direction," said William Antholis, director of the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs. "But it's only one step."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Trump-backed revived healthcare bill &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/331018-republicans-wont-vote-on-obamacare-repeal-bill-this-week" target="_blank"&gt;failed to secure enough votes&lt;/a&gt; to move ahead in the House this week. Antholis notes that the administration could possibly eventually pass this bill through backroom wheeling and dealing, but sees no clear path for it to proceed as is. And Trump's tax proposal has already &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-25/trump-changing-tactics-on-tax-after-health-care-repeal-failure" target="_blank"&gt;spooked conservative Republicans&lt;/a&gt; who don't know how it would be paid for. "Everyone who's looked at his tax reform proposal says it's dead on arrival," Antholis said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Antholis suspects that the Trump administration still doesn't have a great deal of legislative know-how on staff. Villanova congressional expert John Johannes added that while Trump seems more capable of wining and dining congressmen than former President Barack Obama, there is still "no strategy for the big picture." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Trump also hasn't abandoned the reliance on public threats, even those these have failed to work for him to date. When he &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/26/trump-first-100-days-president-rating-accomplishments-215071" target="_blank"&gt;lambasted conservative Republicans&lt;/a&gt; after his first healthcare failure, they ignored him. More recently, he hinted that he'd stop making subsidy payments to keep insurers in Affordable Care Act markets if Democrats didn't fund his border wall as part of the 2017 budget—then&lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/26/nancy-pelosi-mick-mulvaney-clash-budget-237630" target="_blank"&gt; backed off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Trump doesn't need to shift fully to soft touches, noted Johannes, but "clever presidents know when to push, when to beg, when to cajole, when to threaten… Trump is a long way from that skill level."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While his latest legislative push has seemingly had more time and breathing room built into it, Republicans reportedly still felt like he was rushing on both &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-leaders-downplay-revisions-to-health-care-bill-offered-by-house-moderate/2017/04/20/3890a8f8-25d7-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html?utm_term=.8cbb95cc6953" target="_blank"&gt;healthcare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/26/politics/congress-tax-reform-analysis/" target="_blank"&gt;the release of his tax plan&lt;/a&gt; to score points by day 100. And Johannes believes that while some flexibility is good, Trump still seems to care too little about policy details. "He seems too focused on getting &lt;i&gt; something&lt;/i&gt; done," said Johannes, "rather than getting it right."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It doesn't help, the experts I spoke to agree, that Trump is so unpredictable; to make deals with Congress, legislators have to be able to trust you. Nor does it help that his administration has yet to fill, or even nominate candidates for, &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/26/trump-first-100-days-president-rating-accomplishments-215071" target="_blank"&gt;more than 500&lt;/a&gt; key administrative jobs, many of which deal with shepherding policy priorities along. "There is absolutely no evidence that Trump even cares about filling those" positions, said Johannes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "I have not seen anything that would indicate [Trump] has changed his modus operandi as it relates to legislation," said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime Senate staffer. "He is still learning that it's not quite that easy to take on major policy changes and [have it so that you] snap your fingers and it happens." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hoagland believes that to actually move forward on any of his key legislative promises, Trump is going to have to learn "that compromise is not a four-letter word [but] a necessary ingredient for a democratic process." He'll have to temper his own positions into a middle ground between whatever coalitions of willing Democrats and Republicans he can put together. Hoagland has heard from people who've worked with Trump that he can be a good listener behind closed doors. &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/20/trump-first-100-days-year-presidency-215040" target="_blank"&gt;However, some&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/specials/donald-trump-first-100-days" target="_blank"&gt; observers worry&lt;/a&gt; that Trump's initial failures and hostility towards Democrats have poisoned the wells for this kind of pragmatism. "To be brutally frank," admitted Hoagland, Trump "is going to have to invite the Democratic leadership to Camp David—I would hope not to Mar-a-Lago. He's going to have to find some way of reaching out."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even if he remains as he is—still bellicose, inexperienced, and prone to chaos—Antholis suspects Trump can still score a few legislative agenda wins over the next 100 days, or by year's end. "If you forced me to bet," he said, "it would be the repatriation of foreign earnings for companies. You might also get some sort of marginal corporate tax cut [or] a few other tax changes. For each of those, it's 50-50. It's a coin toss… But those things could happen."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That may be offset by the fact that team Trump is running out of other low-hanging fruits. According to Wake Forest University regulatory expert &lt;a href="http://law.wfu.edu/faculty/profile/shapirsa/" target="_blank"&gt;Sidney Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;, Republicans can slash a few more regulations via the Congressional Review Act, which Trump and Congress have used to&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/how-trump-has-taken-the-republican-war-on-government-to-the-next-level"&gt; eliminate several Obama-era rules&lt;/a&gt;. But the CRA only applies to rules enacted late in Obama's second term and most of the GOP's top target regulations have, he said, likely already been axed. Shapiro notes that Trump and company will find it a grueling process to actually change rules moving forward, and almost impossible to fully rescind them in most cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Though it's only spring, Trump actually doesn't have much time to tackle healthcare and taxes. "Moving not just one but two major pieces of legislation not just through the House, but through the Senate, through the requisite committees, then reconciling what's different is just hard to do that fast," said Antholis. And as the midterm campaign season approaches, some members of Congress will worry about taking risky votes, especially in the service of a president whose approval rating is below 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; All in all, Trump will be fairly lucky if his next 100 days aren't just as bad as his first. Or as Antholis put it, "as different as these two characters are… he really runs the risk of having a Carter-like presidency." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Mark Hay on &lt;a

Old</title><summary type="text">When teens think you might rat them out for smoking weed, you are old.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt; If you're looking for a quick way to depress yourself this weekend, you're in luck: Just open up Google and punch in "things that happened 20 years ago."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yep. With just a few keystrokes, you can be reminded that "Backstreet's Back," "Song 2," and "Hypnotize" all turned 20 this year, or that "Hot in Here," &lt;i&gt; The Royal Tenenbaums&lt;/i&gt;, and the first Harry Potter movie turned 15. You too can feel thoroughly ancient in the knowledge that "Back to Black" and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/how-there-will-be-blood-anticipated-trumps-america"&gt;&lt;i&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are now ten years old, and that it's been two decades since Notorious B.I.G. was murdered, 17 years since Bush's first term, and 14 years&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97CtEReZEaQ" target="_blank"&gt; since this happened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Think of them as pre-senior moments: not quite on par with forgetting why you walked into a room or shitting yourself in a movie theater, but a quick and painful reminder that it's now been almost two decades since anyone uttered the word "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6Rms5J7nGI" target="_blank"&gt;Willennium&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The good news is, we're not alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to stave off your approaching existential dread, we've collected anecdotes from folks who feel just as elderly as you do. Our peers have dug deep to share their very first pre-senior moments, whether they be physical (things breaking or aching), psychological (Dear God, people born in 2000 are approaching legal drinking age), or simple realizations, like the fact that the cast of&lt;i&gt; Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ew1460_sarah_james_8021792332982.jpg?w=669" target="_blank"&gt; now look like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because while we may not look like older generations—with their stable incomes, reasonable tuition fees, and actual shot at home ownership—by God, do we ever feel like them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 6400px;" data-iframely-id="357Kvew" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/357Kvew?summary=true&amp;app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Xander, 34&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Last spring, I passed a group of teens smoking weed on a bench, and they attempted to hide it when they saw me. Most people know I smoke, and even two or three years ago, kids that age would have invited me into the circle. Now I'm clearly seen as an old man. Whatever. Like I'd smoke with them, or have anything to do with their bunk-ass herb."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Mitch, 31&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "The first time I felt old was at a lesbian event. This woman was hitting on me hard, and I knew she was way too young for me. I finally said, 'You're sweet and attractive, but you're much too young.' She said 'No, I'm not.' Then I told her what year I was born. She looked horrified and said 'So was my mom.' Needless to say, she backed off."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Cynara, 34&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; "When some kids 'ma'amed' me in a hotel lobby in SoHo while trying to convince me to buy them booze at a nearby bodega. This was like five years ago, so I was still in my 20s."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Nate, 28&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "One morning, I woke up extremely hungover, with no memory of the night before, and I was startled to discover I couldn't move. My back had seized, and I had to yell for my roommate to help roll me out of bed. I was 24."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Jason, 34 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Meeting a girl in a bar who, after running her hand along my abs, assured me she was 'actually a big fan of the dad bod.'"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Souzan, 32&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; "A day or two after my 30th birthday, I passed the mirror and suddenly realized my ass was a different shape, and I had laugh lines. It was like a switch went off after 30, because I'd never noticed either of those things before."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Melissa, 33 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "When I was walking down the hallway at my work—which also happens to be my alma mater—and I saw kids pointing at grad photos and laughing at the old styles, I thought to myself, &lt;i&gt; I remember doing that in high school&lt;/i&gt;. Then I got closer and realized they were looking at my grad class."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Tara, 29&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "A few years ago, I threw my back out while trying on shorts."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Aliez, 33&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Being identified as the 'slender, dark-haired, middle-aged lady' at work. Then being told it was meant as a compliment."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Billeh, 38&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "I was teaching a college class and mentioned Corey Hart in reference to a student writing about sunglasses. Most of the class looked at me like I was speaking Latin. I asked them to raise a hand if they knew who Corey Hart was. Only two of them knew. This was a few years ago. Now I feel ancient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 2400px;" data-iframely-id="ftld8S8" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/ftld8S8?summary=true&amp;app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dana, 30&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"When my kids told me I was an adult."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Rachel, 24&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "I threw my back out in the middle of downward dog and couldn't straighten out. I basically just toppled over onto the floor, wheezing because it hurt so much, and I couldn't figure out why. I was 22."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Eve, 44&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "When I became invisible to anyone under 35."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Nat, 31&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "When I realized that almost every athlete at the Olympics was younger than me. Also, when I had to explain who OJ Simpson and Tonya Harding are to a college kid."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Dina, 29&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "When I started considering that some dresses might be too short for me to wear. I still wear the short dresses, but a few years ago, I thought twice about it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Ashley, 35&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "I threw my back out bending down to get laundry out of the washer. I had to walk with a cane for a day or two."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Matt, 32&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Making &lt;i&gt;Simpsons&lt;/i&gt; references and having people—even people in their 20s—ask what I'm quoting. Am I so out of touch? No, it's the children who are wrong."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Bill, 52&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "I own a 1965 Mustang (same production year as me.) Back in 2002, a lovely woman in her mid 20s was admiring the car. She asked about the year, I told her. She asked if it was an antique, and I said 'yes.' Then she asked if I was the original owner."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Natalie, 33 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "I woke up in a hurry, didn't stretch, and literally couldn't move my knee. It hurt so much, and I ended up on the ground in the fetal position wishing I was dead. At first I thought, &lt;i&gt; Shit, I must have twisted my knee&lt;/i&gt;. Nope. I did nothing during that week that would involved any kind of knee activity. I'm 33 this year, and my knees will be 75."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Amanda, 29&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "A few days ago, after IDing someone born in 1998, then giving them alcohol. Which led to the realization that in less than two years, people born in the year 2000 will be almost old enough to drink."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Marc, 37&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Getting hurt and it never healing. Stepped on a rugby field five years ago for the first time since 1996 (literally). Missed a tackle, slipped, tweaked my medial ligament. Still hasn't healed. Also, the time I got told that I was hot... because she was 'totally into older guys.'"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Harla, 32&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; "I went cliff-jumping with a 20-year-old and fractured my spine while the 20-year-old was fine. It was a pretty bad compression fracture. Some bone was sticking out toward my spinal cord, which caused some worry at first. I hobbled out of water and back to the car with the help of the other 20-year-old, and I was taken to the larger hospital in Sydney. I was then strapped to a spinal board. I had a back brace for about a month and a half and then restricted mobility for another month and a half. Again, the 20-year-old was totally fine. The worst part is, I was in better shape than they were, but apparently that didn't matter to my bones. This was two weeks after my 30th birthday. That's when I learned that our warranty expires after 29."&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="People Tell Us About the First Time They Felt Old" rel="alternate"

Film Festivals Are the Next Frontier of LGBTQ Tolerance</title><summary type="text">Far from the coasts, with moving stories in darkened theaters, people's minds are changing.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt; In the fall of 2015 in tiny Lewisburg, West Virginia, Tim Ward and Jon Matthews were gearing up for the second annual &lt;a href="http://aqff.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Appalachian Queer Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; (AQFF for short). Their mission was both simple and profound: to broaden hearts and minds, to change stereotypical perceptions of West Virginians, and to shed light on what it means to be queer in a rural community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That same year, they'd received a $6,700 grant from the West Virginia Humanities Council to help fund the festival. It proved significant in helping them garner interest and participation in the festival. With that success and encouragement within the WVHC, they applied for $10,000 for their third year, to be held last October. But a few days before they applied, a Koch Brothers-funded PAC released a report &lt;a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160128/conservative-group-targets-colleges-public-broadcasting-arts-funding-as-waste" target="_blank"&gt;lambasting the state&lt;/a&gt; for wasting taxpayer money on arts projects—specifically calling out AQFF for screening "films many taxpayers would find objectionable."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report was far from an exhaustive study, the &lt;a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160128/conservative-group-targets-colleges-public-broadcasting-arts-funding-as-waste#sthash.7OSytAlr.dpuf" target="_blank"&gt;Charleston Gazette Mail reported&lt;/a&gt;—but it condemned spending for Medicaid, public broadcasting, fairs, festivals, community colleges, athletics and arts programs nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As a result, AQFF saw no public funding last year, which had been projected to comprise half their overall budget, Ward said. In October, Ward and Matthews were able to put on a watered down version of their showcase, and remain dedicated to bringing notable queer films to West Virginia audiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "On Saturday we're screening Travis Matthews' &lt;i&gt; Discreet&lt;/i&gt;," said Ward, which "follows a young man in rural Texas trying to reconcile a conservative culture and his own sexuality. While his plight is not every LGBTQ person's journey, it presents an interesting perspective worth comparing to our own."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When we think of LGBTQ gatherings and celebrations, we conjure images of Provincetown's Carnival Parade or the massive OutFest film festival in LA. But outside Christopher Street or the Castro, film festivals like AQFF and other events are playing a vital role in galvanizing rural LGBTQ communities, where opportunities to celebrate one's identity are limited—and not solely because of intolerance, as one might assume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rural queer communities are "often in regions where there aren't a lot of public resources," said Mary L. Gray, a senior researcher at Microsoft and associate professor at the Media School of Indiana University. "There's no public infrastructure, there's no tax base to build that—so when communities want to come together there's literally no space to gather."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "There's no gay bar or corner queer bookstore," she continued, "so it's important that film festivals are using what infrastructure is available—an established shared public space—to bring a conversation to a community that otherwise would not have a venue." In this way, festivals like AQFF queer an otherwise universal space: the movie theater.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every year, the &lt;a href="http://fmlgbtff.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Fargo-Moorhead LGBT film festival&lt;/a&gt; in North Dakota takes place in the city's historic Fargo Theater, a point of local pride. Paducah, Kentucky's &lt;a href="https://www.cinemasysters.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cinema Systers Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; claims to be the only entirely Lesbian film festival in the US. From Greenville, North Carolina's &lt;a href="http://www.teadancefilmfestival.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Teadance Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://reelpride.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Fresno Reel Pride&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://bloomingtonpride.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomington PRIDE Festival&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.coloradowestpride.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Colorado West Pride&lt;/a&gt;, AQFF is far from alone in making inroads in unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; These film festivals and others queer their town movie theaters for screenings, Elk's Lodges for fundraisers and churches for meetings. They blur the boundaries of who belongs where and who has claims to be members of one's community. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "The visibility of film festivals reminds the heterosexual members of a community of LGBTQ presence," says Dr. Katie Schweighofer, an assistant gender and sexuality professor at Dickinson College. "The structure brings cultural cachet and tourism dollars that may be useful in gaining support from hesitant community or business leaders."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Moreover, seeing and hearing a moving tale in a dark room offers one of the least confrontational ways to participate in someone else's narrative. "There isn't direct dialogue so much as a dialogue being performed for the audience," said Gray, "so it can be an incredibly rich role modeling of what kind of words can be used around these identities that otherwise is just not a part of day to day life in rural communities."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And with the inauguration of a president with a history of &lt;a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/02/the-top-ten-worst-comments-donald-trump-has-made-about-lgbtq-people/" target="_blank"&gt;homophobia,&lt;/a&gt; it's important to remember the classism that marks many discussions about who belongs where in America. LGBTQ political leaders have for too long paid too little attention to rural communities as places to organize—and where there's more tolerance and support on offer than one might expect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "There were so few times that we ventured into places where we knew people didn't like us," said Gray, referring to the marriage equality fight. "This is a detriment to queer politics as much as it is to the 'public sphere.' We are limiting our own capacity by presuming that wealth and the power of personal persuasion are our only ways into freedom and equality for all."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There is often a message, or perhaps it's more of an internal monologue, that LGBTQ-identifying people would or should "get out" of their small towns. While some will and can, many don't have it as an option or don't want to leave. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dr. Schweighofer emphasized that with many of the most significant recent gains in American LGBTQ rights—Don't Ask Don't Tell, Obergefell—having come from the federal level, the time is ripe to focus efforts on rural communities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "With the new administration signaling they will not be supporting LGBTQ communities—for example, by removing LGBTQ content from the White House websites and changing a proposed addition for adding LGBT to the upcoming 2020 census—LGBTQ communities may find themselves reliant upon local politics for positive change," she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ward, now a full-time student headed towards a medical degree and still a part-time film enthusiast, has gone back to the drawing board with Matthews and their handful of private funders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "We're taking a strategic approach and branching out into different parts of the state with one-off events, like screening a film and bringing in the filmmaker or doing a talk via Skype," he said, "in hopes of introducing the festival to people that might not have known about us before and would have an interest in driving to Lewisburg." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "As of now, we're still committed to having the larger festival in the fall, the size of which is dependent on our bottom line," he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow &lt;a href="http://www.valentinavalentini.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Valentina Valentini&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tiniv?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="Rural Film Festivals Are the Next Frontier of LGBTQ Tolerance" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rural-film-festivals-are-the-next-frontier-of-lgbtq-tolerance" type="text/html"/><link title="Rural Film Festivals Are the Next Frontier of LGBTQ Tolerance" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/59037c230f195a1453032df6/lede/1493407640556-lgbtq_films.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Valentina Valentini</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Valentina Valentini</id></author><category term="LGBTQ"/><category term="travis matthews"/><category term="Appalachian Queer Film Festival"/><category term="AQFF"/><category term="Discreet"/><category term="LGBTQ film festival"/><category term="Gay film festival"/><category term="Rural pride"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-28-19</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-28T19:48:51.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>5901c3aa82e7a569c2544a31</id><published>2017-04-28T19:04:00.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-28T19:04:00.000Z</updated><title>'Sympathy' Offers a Fresh Literary Take on Instagram and Intimacy</title><summary type="text">The book takes a standout approach to social media with a smart and lyrical evocation of that murky emotional terrain between our online and offline.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; Sympathy&lt;/i&gt; opens with what must be the most intense description of an Instagram follow request ever committed to print. Alice Hare, the 23-year-old narrator, relates the agony of waiting to be granted access to a private account. She aches for that pale grey "requested" button to give way to its more reassuring successor; to confirm that she's "following." With this, the stage is set for a contemporary tale of obsession.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It feels as though the world has been waiting for a literary take on the photo-sharing app. Who among us hasn't been queasy after a bout of girl crush stalking, or that very particular self-aware frustration when unable to find the right angle for a selfie? &lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; posting would be like having a margarita without the salt. What makes&lt;i&gt; Sympathy&lt;/i&gt; such a standout in its approach to social media is a move way from &lt;i&gt; Black Mirror&lt;/i&gt;-style satire and, instead, a smart and lyrical evocation of that murky emotional terrain between our online and offline selves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The novel, written by 28-year-old London native Olivia Sudjic, has already been praised by the likes of British editor Diana Athill and is one of the most talked about debuts of the year. We meet in a cafe near my apartment, which I've chosen specifically for its Instagrammable properties: millennial pink tables and food served on pastel plates. It's the kind place I imagine &lt;i&gt; Sympathy's &lt;/i&gt;characters might post about, tagging the location like a breadcrumb to be found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alice, the book's lead, is living in limbo after graduating from college, and in search of a "single, coherent narrative" about her origins (something her adoptive English mother has been unable to supply.) After striking up a correspondence with her sick grandmother, Alice travels to New York to help out during Silvia's cancer treatment. Once there, she becomes increasingly obsessed with a Japanese writer and Instagram cool-girl named Mizuko, and Alice detects odd parallels between their life stories. Any similarities that might not be present between the pair, Alice is able to manufacture, mining Mizuko's online presence for likes and interests with which to furnish her own personality. When Alice orchestrates a "chance" encounter with the writer—all thanks to geotags—Mizuko is unable to see that what feels like a happy coincidence is anything but. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article__media"&gt;&lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 25em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 40.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 53.125em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493288513701-olivia.jpeg" alt="Olivia Sudjic portrait at Cafe Miami by Imogen Freeland"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="article__image-caption"&gt;Olivia Sudjic portrait at Cafe Miami, Clapton, by Imogen Freeland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of wry humor and sharp observations, &lt;i&gt; Sympathy&lt;/i&gt; explores the ways we struggle to fully understand an experience that is not our own. We relate to others—as we must—through our own limited perspective. In this era of hyper-connectivity, the illusion of sympathy is everywhere, but are we really connecting in the way that we imagine ourselves to be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sudjic describes how, at 25, she'd tried a few different jobs and found herself working at a branding consultancy, but the idea that would evolve into &lt;i&gt; Sympathy&lt;/i&gt; had already begun brewing. She decided to take a six-month sabbatical. "Of course, what happened is that I didn't write anything," she says. "Suddenly I had all this free time. I just freaked out." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of the six months, Sudjic's boss told her that they'd given her job to someone else, but that she was welcome to take a role in the Dubai office. "There was nothing like the threat of having to leave London to light a fire under my ass!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__pull-quote"&gt;"Throughout history, the tools we make end up shaping us."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She wrote the bulk of the book in three months in a self-confessed "fever dream," fitting for a novel rife with mysterious illnesses, identity slippages, and swift, feverish descents down social media's rabbit holes. The narrative's non-linear structure imitates the feeling of scrolling through an Instagram feed, where past and present co-exist and a #TBT might pop up at any time. It was meticulously plotted, so that Sudjic's writing space looked more like "a crime scene" than an author's desk. "It just felt like a much more authentic way of storytelling according to the way modern minds work," she says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Surprisingly for a book that reads like &lt;i&gt; The Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/i&gt; for the 21st Century, Sudjic says that she initially conceived it as a historical novel about a 17th century "medicine" called &lt;i&gt;Powder of Sympathy&lt;/i&gt;. "I'm quite glad now that I can talk about this historical element, because it guards against the idea that this book is only about now.

"I was interested in how the internet sees you," Sudjic says. "To a machine, you're viewed as this collection of metadata; the things you like and click on, what you've spent time doing." What's most specific in Alice's characterization are the traits that can be easily understood by our devices: locations she visits, the amount of time she spends walking around the city, and the sights she captures through the lens of her iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the first person narration, Alice's inner-psyche remains blurry, mimicking the way someone is seen by a browser's internal algorithms. Later in the novel, strange coincidences begin to occur that mirror how a Facebook advert might anticipate a user's needs. "These things that we think are all about choice are actually being predicted, nudged, and shaped. What we get access to online, the links that float to the top of our searches—that's all colored by information we often don't even realize we've given out."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__pull-quote"&gt;"The digital apparatus we have with which to affect change slightly tricks us into feeling like we're more powerful than we are, and actually, we're quite passive."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sudjic compares buying a smart phone to a kind of Faustian pact: "There's this trade off between privacy and convenience." She points me to the novel's epigraph, a line from &lt;i&gt; Alice Through the Looking Glass&lt;/i&gt;, in which Alice tells the Red Queen, "I wouldn't mind being a pawn, if only I might join." It is exactly this bargain we enter into when we share information about ourselves online. I ask whether Olivia was nervous about writing Alice as a character who, though the driving force of the novel, is quite passive—a pawn—when it comes to her interactions IRL. "She is passive, but I feel like that passivity is what a lot of our generation is coping with. The digital apparatus we have with which to effect change slightly tricks us into feeling like we're more powerful than we are, and actually, we're quite passive."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It's proof of Sudjic's electric talent that Alice's voice remains captivating, even as she seems to become a conduit for other people's experiences (her boyfriend Dwight's, for instance.) Alice is simultaneously relatable and inscrutable, sympathetic, caustic, and infuriating all at the same time. Of course she is—she's a 23-year-old trying to figure out her place in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Acutely aware of the difference in the ways male and female novelists are asked to promote their books, Sudjic says she fought hard to keep the novel's original title. "I just thought, &lt;i&gt;if Franzen can do it, I can&lt;/i&gt;. Men seem to have ownership of those one word titles. Also, I couldn't believe that it hadn't already been used, given what novels, from their genesis, are supposed to be about." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss the first American novel, &lt;i&gt; The Power of Sympathy: &lt;/i&gt;"It was about how we can over-identify with characters and it can lead us astray morally." Sudjic was drawn to the idea that novels used to be a slightly perilous moral undertaking. "Now novels are good and it's Instagram that's bad. Every single time a new format comes up for identifying with other people, we all throw up our hands thinking it's a disaster."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For Alice and Mizuko, it just might be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sympathy&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;by Olivia Sudjic is published by ONE/Pushkin Press on the May 4, via &lt;a href="http://pushkinpress.com" target="_blank"&gt;Pushkin Press&lt;/a&gt;.

What's more, it would give speakers the right to sue UW if their events were shut down by students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pending legislation comes at a time when tensions between liberal protestors and conservative speakers are at an all-time high. In the past few months, universities across the country have routinely dissolved into chaos as polarizing figures have tried to speak there. Late last January, a man was &lt;a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/northwest/how-the-shooting-at-the-uw-protest-of-milo-yiannopoulos-unfolded/" target="_blank"&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; during a Milo Yiannopoulos protest at the University of Washington. Students effectively &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/college-protesters-explain-why-they-shut-down-charles-murrays-speech"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; eugenicist Charles Murray from speaking at Middlebury University in March, and on Wednesday, right-wing pundit Ann Coulter &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/politics/ann-coulter-university-of-california-berkeley.html" target="_blank"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; her scheduled appearance in Berkeley after administrators said they couldn't protect her from possible violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2015, the University of Chicago &lt;a href="https://freeexpression.uchicago.edu/sites/freeexpression.uchicago.edu/files/FOECommitteeReport.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a report that said campus protestors there "may not obstruct or otherwise interfere with the freedom of others to express views they reject or even loathe." A conservative think tank called the Goldwater Institute later &lt;a href="https://goldwater-media.s3.amazonaws.com/cms_page_media/2017/2/2/X_Campus%20Free%20Speech%20Paper.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a model of how to turn the Chicago report into law, and Wisconsin is just the latest state to consider adopting a version of it. It's &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/04/04/free-speech-zones-abolished-on-colorado-campuses/" target="_blank"&gt;already happened in Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and Republicans in Michigan, North Carolina, and Virginia are also apparently considering introducing similar bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal director of the Wisconsin chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union &lt;a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8ddb54e795514977b800a23ae518b132/gop-bill-would-discipline-hecklers-college-speeches" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Associated Press that the bill was "unnecessarily draconian." Meanwhile, one of the bill's key sponsors argues that the Campus Free Speech Act will protect free expression by expelling students who use it to voice their distaste for unpopular viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All across the nation and here at home, we've seen protesters trying to silence different viewpoints," Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said in a statement on Thursday.

Although her favorite sitcoms presented the US as idyllic and family-oriented, her favorite &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; taught her the exact opposite could just as easily be true. After six-year-old beauty queen JonBenét Ramsey was murdered in Boulder, Colorado, on Christmas Eve of 1996, a young Green became one of the millions of people around the world transfixed by the ensuing investigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This case punctured that image for me," she says. "I was 11 or 12 when it was on TV, and as a kid I was obsessed with it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That obsession apparently followed her into adulthood. Green, now 32, is the director behind a new JonBenét movie premiering today on Netflix. Like &lt;i&gt;American Crime Story&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Made in America&lt;/i&gt; did for the O.J. Simpson saga last year, &lt;i&gt;Casting JonBenét&lt;/i&gt; introduces the story of the Ramseys to a generation who missed the original media spectacle around it. The film is a hybrid of documentary and scripted narrative––a CliffsNotes version of an important piece of Americana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason&lt;i&gt; Casting &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;JonBenét&lt;/i&gt; defies easy categorization is because Green has never felt comfortable in either genre. She says that, as a young woman, it was hard to be at ease around the large gaffers and grips that typically populate huge cinematic productions; after making a documentary about a feminist group in the Ukraine in 2013, she missed the control she felt while working on narrative films at school in Melbourne. To solve her dilemma, Green pioneered a liminal genre in 2015 with &lt;i&gt;Casting Oksana Baiul&lt;/i&gt;, a short film about Ukrainian women who derived feelings of strength from the titular gold-winning figure skater.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it's tempting to suggest that Green is riffing on the JonBenét case as part of a larger, multi-work meditation on how different societies treat their young female performers, she says that any thematic similarity is merely a coincidence. Instead, she says that JonBenét is more accurately described as a meta commentary on the community members who were affected by having an infamous true crime story take place in their hometown. For instance, the film starts off with a scene of matriarch Patsy Ramsey dialing 9/11 to report the murder but then transitions into a montage of casting tapes. Each prospective Patsy talks into the camera about her personal connection to the case––whether it be experience as a pageant contestant, as a teacher with students who knew JonBenét, or simply as a mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's to be expected that the acted bits seem straight out of a Lifetime movie. After all, the people trying out for the film are not professional Hollywood actors by any means, but largely blue-collar workers like grocery store managers or cops. What's interesting is not whether or not the actors are being convincing in their portrayals of the crime's players, but rather how their lived experiences inform those portrayals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Green told me that she spent 15 minutes with each actor who showed up to her casting call pitching the premise of the film: There was a three-page treatment and no script. Casting tapes would be used in the film. Multiple actors would be playing each role. It was an experiment––a sort of choose-your-own adventure meets community playhouse––and would they like to participate?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She attributes the almost-universal enthusiasm to the notion that Americans love to talk in general. Amplify that by the fact that nothing's really going on in Boulder, and she had people talking about their experiences with murdered family members, molestation, and more within the span of a 45-minute interview.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They've been living in the shadow of this crime for 20 years and they're a little sick of the media coverage, so they've tried to make sense of it themselves," she explained. "So it was nice to have someone ask them about their experiences and how they've found closure. I think they found it a little cathartic."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Historically, there have been two camps of people who follow the JonBenét case: those who think she was killed by a home intruder and others who that thinks a family member did it. Both theories are deftly explored by Green without her giving obvious preference to either one. In a later scene with the Patsys, a series of actresses reads from &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Death of Innocence&lt;/i&gt;, which is the memoir co-written by both JonBenét's parents. One stops reading practically mid-sentence when confronting a self-aggrandizing passage about Patsy's past as a former beauty queen. Another reads the same part but then thinks aloud that JonBenét herself clearly wanted to participate in the contests and wasn't the victim of a so-called pageant mom trying to relive her glory days. Montages of people contradicting each other's theories are woven throughout and become more complicated and compelling as each actor or actress reveals more about their backstory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One theory about the murder is that JonBenét's older brother Burke accidentally committed the murder and that the parents covered it up. Green gets the kids trying out for Burke's role to talk about teasing their siblings and intercuts that with actors trying out for patriarch John talking about dangerous games they played as kids—games that could have easily resulted in her accidental death. Later, the little boys hit a watermelon with a flashlight until it bursts––and the preceding interviews make this the most disturbing and clever portion of the film.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The film ends with a scene of the Ramseys on the night of the murder with different sets of actors playing out several possible scenarios all at once. The camera pans across them, giving the viewer an experience that's not unlike attending a performance of an immersive play like &lt;i&gt;Sleep No More&lt;/i&gt;. While it's a wonder that Netflix picked up such a bizarre, genre-defying movie, it's perhaps even more insane when you contemplate the amount of work the company's legal team must have gone through in order to make sure that the film didn't result in a libel suit. After all, when CBS aired &lt;i&gt;The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey&lt;/i&gt; last September, Burke Ramsey &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/10/cbs-seeks-dismissal-burke-ramsey-suit/" target="_blank"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the network for $750 million in a case that's still working its way through circuit court in Wisconsin. In that docuseries, investigators hired a random 10-year-old boy to hit a pigskin-wig contraption with a flashlight to prove a child could have committed the murder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Green says that it wasn't hard to not promote a specific theory, though, and that's because she genuinely doesn't have one. Although she read every book and watched every film she could get a hand on before going into production, she claims she went in with an open mind. And even after talking to more than 200 people in Boulder about who they thought killed JonBenét, she said that she's still no more closer to the truth than when she was 11 and watching the investigation happen in real time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There's not enough evidence to know who did it, so you have to live with this uncertainty and ambiguity," she says. "And that's what the film became about."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Allie Conti on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allie_conti" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="'Casting JonBenét' Is the Weirdest Movie on Netflix" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/casting-jonbenet-is-the-weirdest-movie-on-netflix" type="text/html"/><link title="'Casting JonBenét' Is the Weirdest Movie on Netflix" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/58ff7ae8cc66f44174332ba8/lede/1493325735372-CASTING_JONBENET_STILL_FINAL_SDCE.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Allie Conti</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Allie Conti</id></author><category term="film"/><category term="documentary"/><category term="NETFLIX"/><category term="true crime"/><category term="Kitty Green"/><category term="JonBenét Ramsey"/><category term="casting jonbenet"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-28-16</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-28T16:42:43.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>58fe13de59dbb060b49c8133</id><published>2017-04-28T16:30:00.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-28T16:30:00.000Z</updated><title>Actually, 'The Great Gatsby' Is Trash</title><summary type="text">Contrary to popular belief, the book isn't so great or novel, although it sure is American.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Among the books everybody's forced to read in high school, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;he Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most famous and definitive. Its legacy goes hand-in-hand with the idea of the Great American Novel—relatively easy to read, lesson-imparting, "universal"—and it's so ensconced in framing who we think we are that its name possesses a stamp of its canonical concreteness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, for one, hadn't read Fitzgerald in the last 20 years, and hadn't planned to before the advent of &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/f-scott-fitzgerald-will-never-die"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'd Die for You&lt;/i&gt;, a collection of Fitzgerald's previously undiscovered stories&lt;/a&gt; that came out earlier this week. I couldn't even remember why I hadn't exactly loved &lt;i&gt;Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; years before, feeling only a vague lingering effect little beyond its name. How had &lt;i&gt; The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; continued to stand the test of time? What gave it grounds for being deemed by &lt;i&gt;Time &lt;/i&gt;magazine&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;as "&lt;a href="http://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/the-great-gatsby-1925-by-f-scott-fitzgerald/" target="_blank"&gt;one of the most quintessentially American novels ever written&lt;/a&gt;"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What I found in my rereading was not what I would call great—or even necessarily sharp—writing, but the mirage of such. Somehow, since its 1925 publication, Fitzgerald's prose seems to have grown bloated, decorously written yet so bland that it feels like it requires a translation from purple to purposeful. The book's certainly not poetic, nor is it particularly well-paced, mostly either digressing about upbringing or meandering through the motions of yet another bourgeois day. "Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope," Nick Carraway admits up front, on the first page. "I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What is he trying to "snobbishly" warn us of? That if we don't see the value in the story he's about to tell, it's we, the readers, who have the problem? At once, then, we can detect the foundations of the myth of Gatsby: Here's a prick of a book we have for too long been afraid to simply call a prick and walk away. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Carraway is a young, well-to-do white guy who takes it upon himself to affectively mansplain his basic life plan to the reader, like some scotch-breathing friend of a friend at a dinner party you should have skipped. We're supposed to be along for the ride with this guy, or so it seems—he's neither so unlikeable as to have a temperature, nor likable enough we hope he turns out OK in the end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's like human wallpaper: a state of being that should be understood up front as devoid of irony, and the kind of people F. Scott Fitzgerald surrounded himself with in daily life and in admiration. He depicted them in this work, whose climate he described to his editor Maxwell Perkins as "&lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2000/12/21/fitzgeralds-radiant-world/" target="_blank"&gt;a sincere and yet radiant world&lt;/a&gt;." Looking back, we shouldn't see the flaws in these characters' outlooks or practices as caricature, or even criticism, but instead as a tale intended to reveal the troubled intersection of their dreams—to feel their yearning, however misplaced. To write it all off now as satire or even foreboding would be to gift it context it does not mean to earn. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plot-wise, &lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt;—like so much realist narrative fiction—is easily boiled down to a handful of bullshit tacked around some semblance of Character Motivations. Nothing substantial really happens—and not in a conceptually compelling kind of way, like Gaddis or DeLillo or Delany, or in a way that nonetheless brings the text alive with nuanced language, like Gass or Stein or Morrison. Basically, we just follow Nick around as he is witness to infidelity on the part of his cousin's husband, later to become drawn in as a sort of wingman for Gatsby to try to help him get in said cousin's pants. There's a bunch of parties where Nick is mostly a bystander, periodically interjecting whitewashed observation as people bicker over relationships and Gatsby blathers amidst his privilege about how he was in the war once. Eventually, there's a car crash and some murder, but even that seems only there to force the story to a head, to wield its point—which, I guess, is that life is short and no one's happy? Well, no shit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Essentially, the book resembles the least titillating episode ever of &lt;i&gt; The Real Housewives of East Egg&lt;/i&gt;. If &lt;i&gt; The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; is indeed definitively American, it's in a way like &lt;i&gt; American Psycho,&lt;/i&gt; without the comedy or the gore—another &lt;i&gt; who's fucking who and who wants to be fucking who&lt;/i&gt; tale, phrased in the most lame and sexless possible way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did I mention that several of these characters speak like white nationalists? "It's up to us, who are the dominant race," says Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband, "to watch out or these other races will have control of things." "We've got to beat them down," Daisy concurs, cementing such an outlook as part and parcel of the novel's emotional marrow. "We're all white here," Nick's date Jordan offers later, an attempt to calm down a fight between the men, as if that fact alone should end the struggle over who owns Daisy's heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Can we just please, at last, say fuck these people? While we're at it, fuck their story, its author, and the book itself. Regardless of how it evokes some state of how things were, perhaps even still in some ways how they are, the book's position as an icon among language-based ambition has long gone stale. As literary fiction, &lt;i&gt; Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; holds up the table for everything we've been told for decades books are "supposed to do": to set up what's going to happen at the end of the story on the very first page, and to display in tedious detail who is speaking and where they are and why. I can actually feel myself getting dumber and more mindless as I read it, almost like suffocating, which is perhaps exactly why it has become inculcated by American schools as a cornerstone of the foundation of our learning: Most media is meant to numb you out, making you care only to the extent that you will buy more of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Which brings me to the conclusion that &lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; is not only not a great novel, but one by which the continued CPR over its legacy has only done us all a psychic damage, both literarily and as a culture. There might have been a time when &lt;i&gt; The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; seemed newfangled or boundary-breaking, or even just a solid literary book, but in our current landscape, it's a barely passable melodrama, one played out by dick-bag socialites and white supremacists, satire or not. Reread &lt;i&gt; The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; as an adult who has read outside of the canonical framework we're presented and you'll realize why so many young people hate to read; because, if nothing else, they can just as easily absorb the exact same sort of story on most any channel on TV. What good's an imagination, after all, when our "greatest novels" seem secondhand to reality's script? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; Blake Butler is the author of several books of fiction, most recently the novel &lt;/i&gt;300,000,000&lt;i&gt;.

Leading up to the closure, VICE will be providing relevant updates and proposals, as well as profiles of community members and businesses along the affected route in a series we're calling Tunnel Vision. Read more about the project &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/were-tracking-the-upcoming-subway-shutdown-that-will-change-nyc"&gt;&lt;i&gt; here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When Dan Levy first proposed the "&lt;a href="http://www.eastriverskyway.com/" target="_blank"&gt;East River Skyway&lt;/a&gt;" in 2014, it was hard to miss a reference to Lyle Lanley, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDOI0cq6GZM" target="_blank"&gt;the shuckster from "The Simpsons"&lt;/a&gt; who bilked a pie-in-the-sky idea that Springfield didn't necessarily want, or need: a shiny, brand spankin' new (but not necessarily functional) monorail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Here was Levy—a businessman who first made headlines with his company, CityRealty, which was a pioneer in online real estate listings—pitching an aerial gondola that could carry 5,000 New Yorkers every hour across the East River, from Brooklyn's Williamsburg to Manhattan's Lower East Side, in 5 minutes flat. Compared to most transit projects, it'd be cheap (one engineer estimated &lt;a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/04/east-river-skyway-project/" target="_blank"&gt;$134 million&lt;/a&gt;), Levy argued, and could be built in no time. But plenty of New Yorkers had heard this sort of gambit before—I mean, Donald Trump &lt;i&gt; is&lt;/i&gt; from here—and attention quickly deflated; "why not?" is an urban design dream that often dies fast here, either due to costs, or regulatory hoops and hurdles. (And the list &lt;a href="http://gothamist.com/2016/06/24/if_you_will_it_it_is_no_dream.php" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is daunting.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But then, news of the L train shutdown broke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Now, facing a transit crisis that will fuck up hundreds of thousands of daily commutes for over a year, Levy's pitch doesn't seem &lt;i&gt; as&lt;/i&gt; far-fetched, nor unwarranted. And, in fact, it's gaining steam: last November, a cadre of elected officials, including Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, &lt;a href="http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2016/11/29/east-river-gondola-plan-closer-becoming-reality" target="_blank"&gt;penned&lt;/a&gt; a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio, urging him to consider the idea in light of the shutdown, while news articles that once made Levy seem overly idealistic have since changed their tune. The proposal even recently &lt;a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/report-suggests-electric-scooters-uber-and-high-speed-gondola-for-impending-l-train-shutdown-9029573" target="_blank"&gt;got a nod&lt;/a&gt; from "Gridlock" Sam Schwartz, which is kind of like the Good Housekeeping Seal, but for New York City development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So VICE reached out to Levy to discuss the Skyway, where he's at in the planning process, and whether or not this is actually happening. Here's what he had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article__media"&gt;&lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 25em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 40.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 53.125em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493390357206-New_York_Shot_02-1.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VICE: So your idea actually predated the L train shutdown news. What did you see happening then in these areas that demanded a project like this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dan Levy: &lt;/b&gt;There's a very significant congestion problem in North Brooklyn, even when the L train is working perfectly fine. So obviously once the thing goes down, it's gonna go from a very bad problem to an absolutely horrendous problem. You've got this fundamental paradox in North Brooklyn, where neighborhoods that become more and more popular—Williamsburg, specifically, but also Bushwick and Greenpoint—kind of become victims of their own growth. You have this situation where you have tens of thousands of new people living in this area, the vast majority of whom work in Manhattan, since the way that the city is configured is that most of your commercial or office space remains there. But there's this thing called the East River that's in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the North Brooklyn corridor, the ways you can cross it you can literally count on one hand: you've got the L train tubes, the bridge—which not only carries cars and buses, but also bikes and the J/M/Z trains—and the ferries. At the end of the day, it's a fairly simple mathematical calculation: you can only stuff so many people in the subway, or across the bridge, everyday. And even today, when the L train is operating "perfectly," you already have this very significant problem where if you try to get on at 8:30, 9am, invariably, it's just massively crowded. Once all of these developments come online over the next 5, 8, 10 years, you're gonna have tens of thousands of new people living here. So the congestion that exists today is, by all accounts, gonna get worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; You come from a real estate background. How did someone like you end up being the guy with the gondola idea?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; I happen to be a lifelong skier, and I was skiing one day about four years ago. I grew up in northern Vermont, where the ski-lift technology isn't known as being advanced, but I happened to be skiing on this mountain that had a brand new gondola system. And I literally said to myself, 'Gee, this is very fancy, very new. Almost feels like a New York City subway car, so large and with so many people.' To make a long story short, I sort of said to myself, 'Why doesn't someone put one of these between Brooklyn and Manhattan?' I did some research, and saw that, lo and behold, a lot of cities around the world were doing exactly that. Places like Rio de Janeiro, Medellín, London, Barcelona, Singapore, and Hong Kong had very recently built these types of systems, and all of them had been successful. Then I looked at the Roosevelt Island tram; we kind of have this type of technology already here in New York, and it turns out that the tram is massively successful. It's the safest part of the New York City public transportation system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Being in real estate, of course, unbearably what you hear locally is the infrastructure is sort of lagging the development. That's a persistent problem everywhere, but certainly here in New York. Specifically with respect to transportation, I think a lot of people recognize that there's just a disconnect between what's getting built and what's needed by these new residents. In order to make these locations viable, you need a very healthy infrastructure. Everyone knows there's a problem, but there's not really any solution. So when I saw this technology and how it was being applied in other cities, I thought it was a natural solution for New York.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Tell me about this technology. How would it actually work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; The technology is incredibly safe, with a record that's better than subways, buses, taxis, certainly bikes. It's obviously totally green, with no on-site emissions, it's totally silent, and it's also very cost-effective to both build and operate. It also turns out that the technology has evolved such that, combined, the size of the cabins and the speed of the transmissions system we're looking at now allow a capacity of 5,000 people per hour, per direction. It's not as much as the L train or any other subway line can transport, but it's more than a bridge can accommodate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even when a bus or subway are operating at peak performance, you still have the expectation that at the station, you'll have to wait a few minutes for the next one to arrive. This technology is continuous, meaning that when you walk into the gondola station, in 30 seconds, you're on a car going across the river. The Roosevelt Island tram, you do have to wait, because it's a tram, but you wouldn't here. Each car would hold 35 people, so they're very large cars that are wheelchair-accessible, and can hold baby strollers, bikes, whatever, no problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Would the Skyway operate as a private entity or would it be city-regulated?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; We envision something that looks a lot like the CitiBike model—so obviously a lot of interaction and interfacing with NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) and other city agencies, but fundamentally privately funded, and privately operated. It'd be fairly traditional private finance, and the aggregate costs are relatively modest, given the projected ridership levels. The concept with the fare, although it's a little early, would be to offer unlimited monthly commuter passes for something like $25 to $30 per month. The real comparison is if you were to take a cab across the bridge, that's probably $12 one way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; I remember the flurry of headlines when you first proposed it in 2014, but what has the process been like since then? What obstacles do you face now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's a little bit of a tricky project—it's not the kind of thing that gets built every day. So we're starting to establish a process that will be followed. We've got a good sense of the regulatory pieces that will need to come together, and in our opinion, there's no red flags that suggest that this can't get done. Now, we're just going to be working through our regulatory pieces. We've got some initial financing that's gonna be finalized relatively soon, and then working through the overall approval. That's the next regulatory hurdle. But with that said, it's complicated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It's not necessarily a complicated project from an engineering perspective, or from a financing perspective, but it's really just complicated from a regulatory perspective. But I do feel like we know what the route is, and it'd be nice if we could present a plan that would have us online for the L train shutting down, but that's beyond our control. That's really for the city to say, 'Yes, we want this in time for the L train to shut down. Or not.' We need that directive from the city. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Most criticism pegs the conflict with the city not being able to do big projects like this anymore, and as a result, it's unrealistic. What do you say to those who say it's unlikely?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's a borderline cynicism, which I understand. Pick whatever project you want—whether it's the Second Avenue Subway, or anything else—and people just think, 'Oh, that's gonna take 30 years, cost billions of dollars, we're never gonna see it done,' so on and so forth. It's skepticism that borders on cynicism, and it's understandable. But cutting through that, and saying, 'Hey, no, this is something we can do quickly, and inexpensively.' I think people like the idea, but think it sounds too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I think we can do it. If the city was able to build one of these things in the 70s, when it was basically on the brink of bankruptcy, we ought to be able to do one now. If they can build one in Caracas, we ought to be able to build one in New York City. And I think there's an appetite for it. The mayor wants to do big projects, and certainly the governor does, too. And when that L train comes back online, you're gonna have the same problem you have now, except you're gonna have another 10, 20, 30,000 people living in the area that need to get into Manhattan everyday. It's not like when the L train comes back online in 2020, we solved the problem—you just made it so the tunnel doesn't collapse. There's no expectation that capacity will be increased by any sort of meaningful amount.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow John Surico on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnSurico"

Thrall makes a persuasive case that instead of leaving the Israelis and Palestinians alone or limply warning of the peril facing Israeli democracy if a two-state solution isn't achieved, the only weapon in the US arsenal that has ever produced meaningful gains on the issue is force—diplomatic, economic, or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The conventional wisdom among the US foreign-policy elite over the past 25 years has been the opposite, directed toward building "faith" and "trust" and avoiding the use of force at all costs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But whether it was Menachem Begin's landmark peace agreement with Egypt in 1979 or Israel's acquiescence to allow limited Palestinian self-government during the 1993 Oslo Accords, what has consistently led to success, Thrall shows, is the willingness of outside parties (primarily the US and Arab states) to apply pressure. And the absence of force accounts for the lack of results. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1977, Jimmy Carter threatened to "withhold aid and downgrade [US-Israel] relations" unless Begin signed an agreement, which he later did in 1979. In 1983, Ronald Reagan blocked arms sales to Israel after it was discovered that Israel was using American weapons in its invasion of Lebanon (Israel withdrew). And in 1991, which was "the last time the United States applied pressure of this sort," Bush administration secretary of state James Baker forced right-wing Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir "to attend negotiations in Madrid by withholding a $10 billion loan guarantee that Israel needed to absorb immigration of Soviet Jews."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The negotiations in Madrid were the basis of what later became the Oslo Accords, the historic agreement that resulted in the creation of the Palestine Authority, a quasi-autonomous-government entity for Palestinians. It also, however, set forth a five-year interim period at the end of which a comprehensive peace agreement was to be reached. This never happened, as Israel's settler population in the West Bank doubled over the following decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Though Thrall spends many pages exploring the fragmentation of Palestinian politics, the essential drama of his book has to do with the Israelis and the Americans, who have been the most important foreign player in the conflict, and for whom Thrall saves his harshest words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; President Obama, who had remarkably close ties to the Palestinian community, is a particular disappointment. Before becoming a senator, Obama had in the past spoken admiringly of Palestinian American advocates and intellectuals like Ali Abunimah and Edward Said, and many pinned their hopes on him to be the American leader who would at long last secure a final peace agreement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After early missteps, Obama's second-term secretary of state, John Kerry, attempted to reignite peace talks in 2013, which ultimately failed in 2014. Thrall, citing sources on diplomatic teams present for the negotiations, writes that these talks were doomed, in part, because Kerry misled both Palestinians and Israelis about what the other side had agreed to at the outset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This final effort from the Obama administration amounted to nothing, Thrall points out, largely because the president did nothing that would have actually pressed the Israelis to accept an independent Palestine. Instead, Obama spent much of his final years in office working on a $38 billion military-aid package for Israel—the largest amount of US aid ever given to a single country. And since 1993, the number of Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank has nearly quadrupled to around 400,000, a rate of entrenchment that has intensified in the last eight years that Netanyahu has been in power. Presenting Israel with a carrot and no stick, Thrall writes, was a strategy doomed to fail from the start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In fairness, as Thrall concedes, Congress would have never allowed Obama or Kerry to do something drastic like threaten to withhold aid to Israel; where Carter was able to condition aid to Israel on peace negotiations without inviting the wrath of a united Congress, Obama faced bipartisan opprobrium for merely declining to veto a December UN resolution condemning Israeli-settlement construction. But if a final, tenable peace agreement really had been within reach (it wasn't), Obama could have perhaps successfully fought back the pro-Israel lobby, as he had with the Iran deal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Under President Trump, the idea of using force to end the Israeli occupation appears more distant than ever. Though recent bouts of Palestinian violence in Jerusalem (what Thrall and others call a "silent intifada") caused temporary disruptions in the administration of Israeli occupation, Thrall notes that these are "occasional bursts of violence that the greatly overpowered Palestinians are too weak to sustain." Simply put, Thrall writes, "There is no contest."—&lt;b&gt;NOAH KULWIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="article__media"&gt; &lt;picture class="article__image"&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width: 25em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547233421-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547233421-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x"&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width: 40.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547233421-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547233421-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x"&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width: 53.125em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547233421-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547233421-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x"&gt; &lt;source media="(min-width: 53.125em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547233421-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg?resize=909:*"&gt; &lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547233421-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg" alt=""&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;PRETENDING IS LYING&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dominique Goblet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York Review Comics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; Pretending Is Lying&lt;/i&gt;, the Belgian artist Dominique Goblet's newly translated graphic novel, opens with a magic trick. The young Dominique falls, and her mother makes the holes in the knees of her tights disappear. Dominique stops bawling and stares in awe at her mother, unaware that the holes have just been flipped to the backs of her legs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Feeling better might require playing pretend, Goblet suggests, though in this tender, messy autobiography, it's often pretending that causes the hurt in the first place. Originally published in France in 2007, &lt;i&gt; Pretending Is Lying &lt;/i&gt;was written over the course of 12 years, as Goblet revisited and reworked episodes at the heart of her most difficult and important relationships. The focal points of Goblet's story are dissimulators: her boyfriend, Guy Marc, who badly disguises his feelings for his ex, and her father, who is in denial about his alcoholism and neglect. Both have the capacity to make Goblet's face grow longer and straighter, receding into a mask of pain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet pretending seems to be the only means of truth telling Goblet trusts. She draws things that aren't there, but that might as well be physically present, like the ghost of Guy Marc's ex, who winds her body around his when summoned by a phone call or innocent question: "Are you really single?" As mood and perspective shift, bodies grow bigger, smaller, more twisted or more luscious. Time collapses as Goblet moves between episodes present and past, and there's often a kind of poetic coincidence at play. The moment Guy Marc and his ex clink glasses at a clandestine dinner date, Dominique is stricken with an ocular migraine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In his afterword, Guy Marc Hinant, Goblet's real-life boyfriend—with whom she collaborated on this project—asks, "What does it mean to write one's own reality?" He might be asking what it means to try to capture the truth of what one has seen and felt, given the intrinsic uncertainty of the past; or what it means to write one's story in defiance of what others believe to be true; or what it means to take control of the narrative of one's life. Most likely, it is all three. In a single question, he illuminates the ambiguities at the heart of this unsparing autobiography, in which the process of refining truths about self and a shared past becomes something akin to love. &lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;REBECCA STONER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="article__media"&gt; &lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547301819-sleepless_300.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; ALL THESE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michal Marczak&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endorfina Studio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; All These Sleepless Nights&lt;/i&gt;, a Polish film directed by Michal Marczak, seems at once like a documentary of hedonistic youth and a contemporary drama about Warsaw's vacuous and lively and bizarrely introspective party scene, a bit like an episode of&lt;i&gt; Jersey Shore&lt;/i&gt; in which everyone is having a yearlong existential crisis. The film follows two friends, the aimless Krzysztof (the narrator) and Michal, as they wonder if they've figured everything out because they've figured nothing out. (They don't do anything.) They party in cramped apartments where it always looks like the tenants have just moved in, and they have conversations on ratty mattresses or in dirty bathrooms about how they aren't sure if they should be partying in cramped apartments where it always looks like the tenants have just moved in. There isn't much of a plot, unless you count the tension Krzysztof causes when he begins sleeping with Michal's ex, or the often humorous and self-aware asides about the nostalgia they're all creating. Mainly, there's a lot of dancing and a lot of drugs. You will finish the film and really want to smoke a cigarette, preferably indoors—though you'll also wonder if that's a good idea.&lt;b&gt; —ALEX NORCIA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="article__media"&gt; &lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547338116-Zelda_300.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nintendo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nintendo's Zelda games have always been consistent in design—sometimes to the point of obstinance. But &lt;i&gt; Breath of the Wild&lt;/i&gt;, which launched alongside Switch, Nintendo's new game console, offers something fresh. You still play as Link, and you're still trying to reunite with Princess Zelda, but nearly everything else surprises. &lt;i&gt; Breath &lt;/i&gt;offers a vast open world (à la the Grand Theft Auto series): The fantasy world of Hyrule is filled with physics-driven puzzles, mysterious legends to unravel, recipes to perfect, and, yes, a great deal of swordplay. &lt;i&gt; Breath&lt;/i&gt; encourages exploration and experimentation in a way that few other games do, and your curiosity is almost always rewarded. But a features list will always miss something about &lt;i&gt; Breath of the Wild&lt;/i&gt;. It isn't just swordfights and treasures. Through its score and visual design, its writing and animation, it emanates a warmth akin to the best Studio Ghibli films. It's an autumnal forest filled with ancient, rusted war machines; a wind-swept field split in two by galloping horses; lightning cracking down toward a rusted sword shoved into the top of a hill. In a year so turbulent, &lt;i&gt; Breath&lt;/i&gt; doesn't offer empty escape; it offers tender respite. —&lt;b&gt;AUSTIN WALKER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="article__media"&gt; &lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547379236-Mosse-1_300.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;INCOMING&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Richard Mosse&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mack Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Richard Mosse's previous projects like &lt;i&gt; The Enclave&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt; Infra&lt;/i&gt; are some of the most instantly recognizable photographic work of recent decades—his use of expired infrared film throws a surreal, unsettlingly beautiful, pinky-purple cast over images of war and devastation in eastern Congo. His latest video work, &lt;i&gt; Incoming&lt;/i&gt;, manages to build on both his penchant for atypical aesthetics and his powerful reappropriation of technology to lend visual impact to already hard-hitting subjects. Using a weapons-grade thermal camera capable of picking out a human being more than 18 miles away, &lt;i&gt; Incoming &lt;/i&gt;tracks the movements of those caught up in the migrant crisis enveloping North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, as well as the conflict driving it. This book, a huge collection of stills from the film, reveals everything from the ghostly heat signatures left on rafts to fighter jets strafing targets and the miserable detritus left by those on the move. Pointing the very technology of war at those displaced by it makes for unsettling viewing. Humans rendered as heat signatures lose identity, and the very scale of this unraveling tragedy is brought to the fore—the hulking ships, heavily armed aircraft, helicopters, and sprawling camps seen in a medium that both clarifies and abstracts them. Incoming lays bare the mind-boggling scale of a challenge that affects us all. —&lt;b&gt;BRUNO BAYLEY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="article__media"&gt; &lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1490547393770-TheLuckyOnesUS_300.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; THE LUCKY ONES&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Julianne Pachico&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spiegel &amp; Grau&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In her first book—presented as a novel by the American publisher and a collection of stories by the English publisher—Julianne Pachico draws a sociopolitical map of her native Colombia, outlined through 11 linked stories, each told from the perspectives of different characters—hostages, children, guerrilla fighters. Focusing on the period between 1993 and 2013, when the Colombian conflict was at its most brutal, the stories have a sense of constant menace. In "The Bird Thing," a wealthy family's live-in maid, who grew up amid poverty and mass killings, is haunted by her mother's prophetic warning: You'll think that you've gotten away, but they'll always come back. In "Honey Bunny," a young woman, who immigrated to New York when she was eight, suffers from a coke addiction that deepens her sense of displacement. In a moment of weakness, she goes through her childhood belongings and finds a jigsaw puzzle of Colombia. As she builds the mountain ranges, the southern jungle, the cities, and so on, the shape of her country comes back to her, but an entire region is missing—it's a nod to loss, being incomplete and wanting to belong somewhere, even if that somewhere is dangerous, because it's home and makes you whole again. —&lt;b&gt;ESRA GÜRMEN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="April's Best Books, Comics, Video Games, and Films" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/aprils-best-books-comics-video-games-and-films-v24n3" type="text/html"/><link title="April's Best Books, Comics, Video Games, and Films" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/58d7f16f5c85026c68e39f8e/lede/1490547597450-Pretending-is-Lying_300.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Noah Kulwin, Alex Norcia, and more</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Noah Kulwin, Alex Norcia, and more</id></author><category term="vice magazine"/><category term="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"/><category term="Richard Mosse"/><category term="Incoming"/><category term="v24n3"/><category term="the only language they understand"/><category term="pretending is lying"/><category term="all these sleepless nights"/><category term="the lucky ones"/><category term="THE LOOKING GLASS ISSUE"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-28-13</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-28T13:07:47.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>58ad3d55be217ed313d0fa56</id><published>2017-04-28T11:20:26.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-28T11:20:26.000Z</updated><title>Gus G &amp; Firewind</title><link title="Gus G &amp; Firewind" rel="alternate" href="https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/gus-g-and-firewind/58ad3d55be217ed313d0fa56" type="text/html"/><link title="Gus G &amp; Firewind" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/videos/58ad3d55be217ed313d0fa56/lede/1493377922657-SOUNDS-GREEK_GUS-GandFIREWIND-HS-00_14_41_17Still041.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Christos Sarris</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Christos Sarris</id></author><category term="music"/><category term="Tour"/><category term="Greece"/><category term="Metal"/><category term="Album"/><category term="guitarist"/><category term="Music, Musical"/><category term="Band"/><category term="gig"/><category term="Thessaloniki"/><category term="πάτρα"/><category term="κιθάρα"/><category term="firewind"/><category term="Μουσική"/><category term="Ozzy Ozborne"/><category term="Gus G"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-28-11</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-28T11:22:45.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>59024d9e5b15f95ec555a8e8</id><published>2017-04-28T04:35:41.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-28T04:35:41.000Z</updated><title>'The Handmaid's Tale' Won't Let Us Forget How We Got Here</title><summary type="text">In a flashback, "Late" depicts the most terrifying scene from the novel in stunning fashion.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Now I'm awake to the world. I was asleep before. That's how we let it happen."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It's hard to watch this episode and not think about every "We all let Trump happen" tweet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The most terrifying scene in Atwood's novel gets pride of place here, with increasingly agitated handheld camerawork following June—not Offred, yet—as her money gets cut off right before every woman in her office is dismissed. It's a perfect staging of her stomach-dropping realization that she waited a day too long to get out. (Later, June and Moira flee a protest as soldiers open fire; later...well, by then it's too late.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The world of &lt;i&gt; The Handmaid&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;s Tale &lt;/i&gt;is chillingly prescient, but that stomach-dropping horror is also a distinctly white fear—a straight fear, the fear of someone whose complacency is shaken for the first time. Enter Moira, a black lesbian, for whom this is just the other shoe dropping. ("They can't do this," June protests. Moira, flat: "They can.") Moira's the one who points out they've already been ignoring red flags and living on borrowed time. June dismisses her; it was just to prevent another attack, she says. But even as she says it she can't look at Moira. She's horrified, realizing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We all" did not let Trump happen. Many were vocal about why he was so dangerous—particularly people of color, the LGBT community, and everyone who you were getting tired of seeing at protests before states started passing legislation to make protest illegal. And "we all" were not asleep before; those same people were up in arms about voters' rights, transparency, and abuse of power before such things became suddenly endangered. But the people who actually let Trump happen were so used to ignoring those other people that it didn't matter to them when it should have, and now the people who will suffer anyway are also asked to share the blame. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The horror of &lt;i&gt; The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt; isn't that misogynists are using religion as an excuse to codify hatred—we have that now. The horror is what happens that morning at June's work. It's the fact that the soldiers have already bought in to the new world order. It's when the men at June's work don't say a word in the women's defense. It's Luke's response to their outrage, a well-meaning "You know I'll take care of you" that visibly makes June's stomach drop. It's the last good night's sleep she ever has.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The episode title is almost more pointedly about this meaning of "late" than it is about Offred's brief, mistaken pregnancy. But that phantom fetus is a fairly potent question. Suddenly Rita's kind, even friendly; suddenly Serena Joy is telling Offred they're in this together. Suddenly someone's &lt;i&gt; asking Offred what she wants&lt;/i&gt;. Elisabeth Moss absorbs it with an incredulity that swings from dry humor to quiet despair, as this hypothetical fetus is granted a level of consideration—of humanity—Offred hasn't gotten, and won't get. (We have that now.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article__media"&gt;&lt;picture class="article__image"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 25em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 40.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 53.125em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 65.625em)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x"&gt;&lt;img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1493323370327-HMT_103_GK_1025_0055rt.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="article__image-caption"&gt;George Kraychyk/Hulu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is an episode about dropping the act. So Offred doesn't play along and pretend there's a pregnancy. Instead, Offred tells Serena Joy exactly how Ofwarren is doing. "I'm afraid she might be losing touch," she says, practically a dare to see if there's any empathy left in Serena Joy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And there is a twisted flicker of fellow-feeling here. Sure, that madness happens to those "weaker girls," but Serena Joy comes strikingly close to admitting the horror of it all. "What you do—what we do together is so terrible..." she says, and almost forgets to finish it on an up note, because the relief of cutting the crap is so visible for both of them that she can barely drag herself back to the party line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Maybe that moment, soured by the first glimpse of the black van, is what drives Offred to stand her ground rather than just play along with something that, in the scheme of things, would cost her nothing. Maybe it's Moira, casting a shadow of resistance across time and space as Offred's abject fear slowly calcifies into a refusal to give in. It's a bold, even foolhardy move for her, given how hard she's trying to play the long game. This isn't the treason charge Offred fears—she could easily "Yes, Aunt Lydia" her way out of it. But even under penalty of pain, she doesn't. She says "gay," not "gender traitor." She says Ofglen was her friend. When she's very nearly out of the woods, she answers chastising Scripture with righteous Scripture; she's not taking the blame for this one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For all the good it does her. Though it's unclear whether she was pregnant and lost it after the interrogation, or just a few days late, whatever benefits that pregnancy may have gotten her are gone as soon as her period comes. (Those who suffer anyway are asked to take the blame.) She's locked in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Of course, not all the horror of &lt;i&gt; The Handmaid's Tale &lt;/i&gt;is portent. Sometimes it's just horror. Serena Joy spits that things for Offred could always be worse; we cut to Ofglen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Before We Go:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That beat in the courtroom in which the accused women stand with gags on while sentence is laid out is one of those scenes you know will be chilling but aren't really prepared for. (Alexis Bledel does more acting in this episode than she's done in the rest of her cumulative body of work. What an affecting bout of silent misery.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something about the interrogation deliberately calls to mind the first episode, where June's forced to shame Janine to give up the last public vestige of solidarity. But she's had time to bear the unbearable; she's seen Janine slowly losing her mind. Sometimes refusal to collude is all you have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Follow Genevieve Valentine on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GLValentine" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="'The Handmaid's Tale' Won't Let Us Forget How We Got Here" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-handmaids-tale-wont-let-us-forget-how-we-got-here" type="text/html"/><link title="'The Handmaid's Tale' Won't Let Us Forget How We Got Here" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/59024d9e5b15f95ec555a8e8/lede/1493323269295-HMT_103_GK_1028_0242RT_f.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Genevieve Valentine</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Genevieve Valentine</id></author><category term="culture"/><category term="tv"/><category term="Samira Wiley"/><category term="alexis bledel"/><category term="The Handmaid's Tale"/><category term="Recap"/><category term="Hulu"/><category term="elisabeth moss"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-28-4</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-28T04:43:33.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>59025ec1d2ba4e55ab92585c</id><published>2017-04-28T04:35:29.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-28T04:35:29.000Z</updated><title>I Escaped My Manic Demons, but My Jailed Clients Often Can’t</title><summary type="text">A social worker struggles to keep the mentally ill poor out of jail.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article was published in collaboration with the &lt;a href="http://themarshallproject.org" target="_blank"&gt;Marshall Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met Raheem in an arraignments shift at the Bronx Criminal Court in New York, where I was slated to serve as his social worker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Raheem had been arrested for stealing lice shampoo from a pharmacy and then getting into a scuffle with the security guard who caught him. As we talked, he fidgeted and scratched at his body while explaining that a lice plague was ravaging the world and only he knew the secret cure. He added that he actually had enough money to buy the shampoo, but couldn't let the store employees know about his plan, so he had tried to sneak out without paying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At the time, Raheem was on parole, stemming from his record of over 30 arrests, almost all of them minor misdemeanor charges related to his unmanaged schizophrenia. The new arrest meant he would be sent to prison for a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The outcome of Raheem's case was hard for me to swallow—and not just because I was part of his defense team. Like Raheem, I too had once shoplifted from a pharmacy while in the grips of a manic episode. For some reason that had felt completely compelling at the time, I needed to stock up on over 20 bottles of nail polish without anyone knowing about it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As a well-dressed white woman, however, nobody suspected a thing and I had simply walked out of the Chapel Hill, N.C., store without notice. The episode ended in a psychiatric hospitalization, through which I received the treatment I needed to get my symptoms under control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even as someone who advocates every day for people with mental health diagnoses, and whose work involves dismantling the stigma that surrounds them, it is still hard for me to disclose my own struggle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the year I graduated from college. It happened after my first full-blown manic episode, in which I sped on a highway at over 100 miles an hour after buying a $3,000 engagement ring on a whim, planning to surprise my then-boyfriend halfway across the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Needless to say, this plan did not come to fruition, and my spontaneity, risk-taking, and impulsivity soon morphed into terrifying psychosis. I was suddenly convinced that my reality was just a big stage and everyone was acting out a script, and I was hospitalized and prescribed anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; About four years after my first episode, I pursued a master's degree in social work with the intention of becoming an advocate for those like me. In a mental health policy class, I remember debating the use of physical restraints, and arguing vehemently against the practice. My classmates did not know that I myself had been strapped to ER beds and restrained in seclusion rooms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But it was in that same class that I learned about the deinstitutionalization and subsequent over-incarceration of people with mental illnesses, and began to slowly comprehend my privilege as a white woman whose circumstances had allowed her to lead a productive and fulfilling life in between episodes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Now that I am a social worker at the Bronx Defenders, I've met many people like Raheem: men and women of color struggling with mental illness while trying to survive in the South Bronx, one of the poorest districts in America. Many end up ensnared in the criminal justice and immigration systems instead of getting the health care they need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And I have met many more clients whose experiences are eerily similar to mine, even if their outcomes could not have been more different. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Not too long ago, I had to call a man to inform him that his brother, Jose, my client, had been arrested in a psychiatric hospital for allegedly assaulting a nurse. I heard him weep on the other end of the phone—and I remembered the time that, in the throes of my own psychosis, amid the chaos of a hallway in the ER, I bit a nurse because I thought she was trying to kill me with laser beams. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I was not arrested. Instead, I was admitted to the psychiatric ward and walked out, restored to my sane self, about two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I'll never forget Jacob either: a green-card holder from South America whom we represented through an immigration public defense program funded by New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Check out the Motherboard documentary about the strange, troubled fate of smart gun technology in America.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-iframely-id="V3TNRol" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-img="" data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/V3TNRol" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jacob had been working as a medical professional when he first began experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia. His illness caused him to lose his job, and he fell into homelessness and substance abuse in an effort to self-medicate. He was in and out of hospitals and ended up being arrested as the result of an incident in which he found himself responding to powerful command hallucinations. His convictions landed him in immigration detention, where he continued to deteriorate and even attempted suicide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite our effort to explain his symptoms and need for treatment, an immigration judge denied his application for relief. Jacob was put on a charter plane back to a country he hadn't been to in decades, where he no longer has any family or access to meaningful treatment. I never heard from him again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It is in moments like these that I feel survivor's guilt most acutely. I have struggled to live with my diagnosis, but how can I reconcile the stark contrast between my experience and those of Raheem, Jose, Jacob, and so many others? Every time I visit my psychiatrist in her Park Avenue office, I feel a pang of guilt accompanied by overwhelming gratitude. Gratitude that I have access to quality care, and gratitude that I respond well to treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My personal experience has been both a blessing and a curse. It has made me more compassionate and patient in working with clients experiencing mental health symptoms, but it also challenges me with painful reminders of past experiences that continue to be shrouded in shame and a feeling of unearned privilege.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So I've learned that to be the best possible social worker for the community I serve, I must understand that vicarious trauma is real—that if I don't try to understand how my own experiences affect my interactions with clients and vice versa, I am doing them a disservice. In the social work profession, we are often in a position of power over our clients, and to some extent, we separate them fully from ourselves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But I think we should all recognize that many of us share much more in common with our clients than we would readily admit. It is time for people like me to say: I, too, am one of &lt;i&gt; them, &lt;/i&gt;but I have been permitted to survive&lt;i&gt; . &lt;/i&gt;Survival should not be a luxury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; Kristen Anderson is a social worker at The Bronx Defenders, a public defense office serving low-income communities in New York City.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="I Escaped My Manic Demons, but My Jailed Clients Often Can’t" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/i-escaped-my-manic-demons-but-my-jailed-clients-often-cant" type="text/html"/><link title="I Escaped My Manic Demons, but My Jailed Clients Often Can’t" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/59025ec1d2ba4e55ab92585c/lede/1493329062614-2000-9.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Kristen Anderson</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Kristen Anderson</id></author><category term="VICE US"/><category term="CRIME"/><category term="mental illness"/><category term="jail"/><category term="mental health"/><category term="Criminal Justice"/><category term="Life Inside"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-28-4</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-28T04:43:33.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>590232afa76cf05ecbbf664b</id><published>2017-04-27T22:53:00.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-27T22:53:00.000Z</updated><title>The Agony and Ecstasy of Fire Island</title><summary type="text">The island, contrary to what you've heard, isn't all high tea and low-blow drama—there's a lot of humanity to it.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt; Tonight marks the premiere of Logo's latest reality series, &lt;a href="http://www.logotv.com/shows/fire-island" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fire Island&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which follows six gay dudes and the self-discovery, fleeting relationships and excessive drinking that accompany one hot summer in New York's gay mecca. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While it's sure to feature sights familiar to anyone who's visited the island (like the annual &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/photos-from-fire-island-gayest-weekend"&gt;Pines Party&lt;/a&gt;), it's also &lt;a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/04/fire-island-series-premiere-recap-season-1-episode-1.html" target="_blank"&gt;faced criticism&lt;/a&gt; for being a bit, well, contrived. Some say &lt;a href="http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2017/3/09/logos-fire-island-contributes-gay-americas-moral-decline" target="_blank"&gt;the show sets the gay community back&lt;/a&gt;; SNL even parodied its ridiculousness with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa4QaNIoPco" target="_blank"&gt;a lesbian spin-off&lt;/a&gt;, contrasting its hard-partying dudes with a house full of even-keeled, wine-toasting, tearful-midnight-conversation-having lesbians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real reality of Fire Island lies somewhere between all that. This show, to be sure, plays on stereotypes—when many think of Fire Island, they probably think of a place not far off from Logo's version, where gay guys let down their hair and sparks and claws fly. But what happens on the island goes far deeper than White Party selfies. It's a near-magical place where people grow up and learn hard truths and sink their teeth into life itself, and from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forgetting-Elena-Novel-Edmund-White/dp/067975573X" target="_blank"&gt;Edmund White&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dancer-Dance-Novel-Andrew-Holleran/dp/0060937068/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493319851&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dancer+from+the+dance" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Holleran&lt;/a&gt;, novels about the Island have enshrined both those qualities. For close to a century, it's been as high culture as it is low, as catty as it is revelatory. There's more to find than dicks in the Meat Rack—you might just find yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One would hope the stars of &lt;i&gt;Fire Island&lt;/i&gt; find themselves, too; judging from the first few episodes, they've all got some growing up to do. But that's what makes for good reality TV, after all. We tapped a roster of gay dudes to hear their life-changing stories from the island, whether ridiculous or profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aaron Perry, LA-based sales executive, on self-consciousness (and choking on meat):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've only been to Fire Island once, for one day, and I somehow managed to publicly humiliate myself in that short amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone on Fire Island has some level of self-consciousness—whether it's fear of bumping into an ex or not looking great in a bathing suit—but not everyone has choked on meat alone at Fire Island &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_dance#Gay_tea_dances" target="_blank"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;. From what I saw and what I've heard, everyone is always grilling out there. But that doesn't mean they do it well. I was at a pool party where I only knew one person. I did what anyone does in those circumstances, hovered by the food. The food happened to be (high protein, low carb) steak kebabs that were wildly overcooked. I started to choke. My throat did this crazy thing that dislodged the steak in what felt like an out of body experience. Embarrassed and alone, I instinctively hid from the party to choke in peace, away from the gays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lived, barely. Had a sore throat for a good week. It remains the perfect metaphor for the fear and shame of Fire Island. And I still have to relive the humiliation every time I tell the story about choking on meat on Fire Island, and then explain it's not a euphemism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://jeffleavell.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Leavell&lt;/a&gt;, writer, on theoretical physics:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was 18, it was late at night, and I was walking back to my friend's parents' house on Fire Island (his dad was gay). I was walking down the boardwalks that cut through the island, and I heard all this moaning in the bushes, and walked into this dune and stumbled upon like 20 guys fucking this one dude. It turned into a full on mini-orgy right there in the night. It was kind of stunning. One of the guys told me he was getting his PHD in Theoretical Physics. He and I spent a lot of time making out, and then we branched off on our own and went down to the beach. We had these long and crazy talks about physics and multiple universes and all kinds of shit. We did a lot of fucking on the beach as well. He talked a lot about infinity and how all the choices we make, the people we are, everything we do, branches off into different directions, creating different universes, so in one universe he and I met and ran away together, living our lives in love. The next day I was walking the beach with my friend. Ahead of us was a wedding ceremony. And, in all the weird ways the world works, there was the guy I had spent the night with, getting married to this blond chick. We made brief eye contact but that was it. I never saw him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/frankiesharp/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Frankie Sharpe&lt;/a&gt;, DJ/party promoter, on getting a desperately-needed cigarette:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; One year I DJed at the BOFFO art festival. I was done with the festival and me and my boyfriend were just wandering the boardwalk, as one does. And then my friend offered me liquid mushrooms, which I had never heard of before? And I hadn't done mushrooms since I was in my early twenties. So I thought, &lt;i&gt;okay, this is hilarious and fun, let's do them.&lt;/i&gt; We took them, and we just started wandering all over the boardwalk, from Cherry Grove back to the Pines. It was me, my boyfriend Alex, and my other drag queen friend, Claudia. We decided to lay down on the boardwalk because it felt like the best thing to do while high, and I decided I really wanted a cigarette—but we couldn't go to the Pantry, because it was like 5 AM. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And I look over, like, do you guys see that? Maybe half a block away there's this moving sling inside of a kitchen—and I'm like oh, there's people in there, and I think they're smoking, because I think I can see smoke. So I really want a cigarette, I'm high on drugs, and I super need this, so I just marched on over there confidently and rang their doorbell, and a full-regalia leather daddy smoking a cigarette was like, "can I &lt;i&gt; help&lt;/i&gt; you?" And I said, "yeah, I was just wondering if you guys had any cigarettes? I &lt;i&gt; really&lt;/i&gt; need a cigarette. I can even give you a dollar." That shitty thing people do. And he was like no, sorry, we have nothing for you, and slammed the door in my face, and I was like, wow! I came back and we were laughing, and we just left, but when we were maybe a block and a half away, all of a sudden we hear "Hey, hey!" and out comes this guy running down the boardwalk, and he's wearing nothing but a harness and one of those puppy tail butt plugs. And he said here, here, here, I have this for you! And he gave me my cigarette for the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's one of those great things about Fire Island, where it's so absurd that you think it's completely appropriate to interrupt this random weird sex leather sling party for a cigarette. But in actuality, it is &lt;i&gt; totally&lt;/i&gt; appropriate. It's part of the magic there. And then I saw my puppy butt plug guy all fresh and dewy with a to-go coffee, a briefcase and a Thom Browne suit on the first ferry back Monday morning on the way to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mitchsunderland" target="_blank"&gt;Mitchell Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;, Broadly staff writer, on wild bears:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've mostly gone to Fire Island for journalism. One time, my colleague Matthew and I stayed at the Belvedere. It's a roughly $400 a night hotel where clothing is optional, women are banned, and most of the furniture comes from estates and old movie sets. The food, though, is mostly danishes that tasted like they came from Costco, served by a boy who kept yelling about how he was going to make Taylor Swift a drag icon. Somehow neither Matthew nor I managed to have sex there. We were sitting outside our room, though, and a fully nude man started hitting on us, trying to pull the "I'm an actor" line—he later let slip he was a real estate agent. But the worst part was that we got no sleep all night because a bear was getting fucked next to a statue outside our window for HOURS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/petshopboy/" target="_blank"&gt;Brandon Graeter&lt;/a&gt;, broker, on underwear party footage you won't see on TV:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the underwear party there's a back room with people hooking up. I don't go back there, but one time I lost my (very drunk) friend and someone told me they last saw him there. I went in and found him wandering the abyss. It reminded me of &lt;a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/SB6ILXmfTkdk4/giphy.gif" target="_blank"&gt;Sandra Bullock in &lt;i&gt; Gravity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—floating in this vacuum of nothingness, grabbing for random dicks and anything that would give him life. I took his hand and pushed us through curtains of sweaty bodies. I was George Clooney in this situation, leading him back to the light. Being at the underwear party is a lot like being space—no one can hear you scream, you can't really breathe, and you go into complete darkness on a mission to explore, only to end up desperate to be home and safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikeymusto" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Musto&lt;/a&gt;, actor, author, and columnist, on that commute:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't like the speedboat between the Grove and the Pines because it's terrifying (and I'm cheap), so I always walk through the Meat Rack to get from one resort to the other. The problem is, once you're in there, you run into creepy looking people wanting to be paddled and adorable deer who are dying to infect you with Lyme disease, not to mention sand that's extremely challenging to walk through, especially if you're exhausted from a full day of gossiping. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But one year, a friend of mine and I tried to do the Meat Rack walk, and we couldn't see any of the above because a thick fog had set in. We couldn't even see our hands in front of our faces. So we clung to each other for dear life and went one scary step at a time for what seemed like hours, ultimately navigating our way back to civilization. It was like some gay Nancy Drew adventure, and ever since then, the speedboat doesn't seem so bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Moore_(director)" target="_blank"&gt;Jason Moore&lt;/a&gt;, director of &lt;i&gt;Pitch Perfect&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sisters&lt;/i&gt;, on sharing a house and unscripted bonds:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having a share on Fire Island in my twenties taught me how to share small spaces, responsibilities, stories, and in some cases, I suppose, how to share men. In these houses, walls were thin and doors were open, so if you drank someone's protein shake or borrowed someone's speedo (perhaps directly off their boyfriend), you were going to come under scrutiny for it. This is where we learned to make amends for such transgressions—or how to throw shade, even on the brightest of days. But mostly and happily, it accelerated friendships. There's nothing like sharing a water view, a walk home, or a common address to bond you to others and to make you feel like you belong to a tribe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow &lt;a

Cash</title><summary type="text">But accepting $400,000 for a speech right after leaving office, when his own refusal to take on Wall Street probably helped elect Trump, is still a uniquely bad look.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, we got a sense of just how many Americans are concerned about the &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/obamas-getting-dollar400k-for-his-first-private-speaking-engagement-vgtrn"&gt;financial prospects&lt;/a&gt; of a family that recently won a rumored &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-book-deal-2017-2" target="_blank"&gt;$60 million book deal&lt;/a&gt;. Social media &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/04/26/barack-obamas-400000-speech-to-wall-street-sparks-liberal-blowback/" target="_blank"&gt;erupted&lt;/a&gt; at the news that Barack Obama will accept a $400,000 speaking fee for a health care conference run by financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Some on the left denounced the buckraking; plenty of others expressed righteous indignation over anyone telling the former president what to do. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And almost no one was honest with themselves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talk of optics and norms and appearances of impropriety and who is allowed to take money from whom represents a grand exercise in denial. The truth is that Obama is &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/big-moneys-obama"&gt;perfectly comfortable&lt;/a&gt; with raking in Wall Street cash. After all, it aligns well with someone who spent massive political capital to shield financial executives from their self-inflicted wounds. Taking this money won't &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/25/15419740/obama-speaking-fee" target="_blank"&gt;undermine what Obama believes&lt;/a&gt; in; it is what he believes in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know this because Obama spokesman Eric Schultz said so in a statement on his boss's behalf. "Regardless of venue or sponsor, President Obama will be true to his values, his vision, and his record," Schultz wrote. "With regard to this or any other speech involving Wall Street sponsors, I'd just point out that in 2008, Barack Obama raised more money from Wall Street than any candidate in history—and still went on to successfully pass and implement the toughest reforms on Wall Street since FDR." (He could have also said "the only reforms on Wall Street since FDR.")&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contrary to the complaint that liberals unnecessarily hold Obama to a higher standard, it's the president himself who is boasting that he can take their money, drink their booze, and vote against Wall Street, to paraphrase the legendary California lawmaker &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-calpolitics-money-missionstatement-story.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Unruh&lt;/a&gt;. But while he did many positive things, when it comes to Wall Street, Obama is either oblivious to his own &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/why-obamas-regulators-let-wall-street-goldman-sachs-bankers-off-easy"&gt;legacy&lt;/a&gt;, or trying to fool you about it. On that front, it's precisely his values, vision, and record I call into question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama inherited a bailout he &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/29/campaign.wrap/index.html?iref=topnews" target="_blank"&gt;whipped&lt;/a&gt; Democrats to support while he was still a candidate. In office, he &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/tim-geithner-and-the-con-artist-wing-of-the-democratic-party"&gt;failed to overhaul&lt;/a&gt; or shrink a financial system that represents everything wrong with the modern economy. He &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/hanks-for-the-memories-0000513-v21n12"&gt;didn't even stop&lt;/a&gt; the bonuses flowing at AIG. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During his transition, Obama &lt;a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=85432" target="_blank"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; up to $100 billion in bailout funds to prevent foreclosure; eight years later, only about &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/" target="_blank"&gt;$24 billion&lt;/a&gt; has been spent, most of it too late to stop the over 9.3 million American families who lost homes in the worst foreclosure crisis in 80 years. The government program Obama's Treasury Department built to mitigate foreclosures, without congressional interference, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/obamas-failure-to-mitigate-americas-foreclosure-crisis/510485/" target="_blank"&gt;became a foreclosure-creation machine instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No banker with any real agency in the crisis &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html" target="_blank"&gt;ever saw the inside of a jail cell&lt;/a&gt; in the most punitive nation on Earth. Even when mortgage companies got caught falsifying mortgage documents in courts nationwide, and stealing homes with false evidence, Obama's Justice Department made no effort to hold individuals responsible, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/what-happened-when-the-fbi-investigated-foreclosure-fraud-in-florida"&gt;instead stonewalling promising investigations&lt;/a&gt; and stringing along a disappointing series of no-fault settlements barely worth the paper they were printed on. For those who say a president is not a prosecutor, I'd submit that then-HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan spending two hours on the phone with me in 2012, defending the &lt;a href="http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com/about" target="_blank"&gt;49-state foreclosure fraud&lt;/a&gt; settlement that let bankers off the hook the day before its &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-government-and-state-attorneys-general-reach-25-billion-agreement-five-largest" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that maybe the White House had something to do with it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama's legacy isn't on the line because of a few speaking fees. It's not even about the money. He made his choice while in office to align with financial power, with the people who write the checks. And this damaged both America's economy and its sense of fairness, rupturing the nation's social fabric. It &lt;a href="https://news.vice.com/story/how-the-financial-crisis-led-to-trump"&gt;set the stage&lt;/a&gt; for the worst leader in modern times to tweet his way into office on a wave of indignation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style="max-width: 4000px;" data-iframely-id="tr291xQ" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 40%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/tr291xQ?summary=true&amp;app=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've made these points &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/how-a-cruel-foreclosure-drove-a-couple-to-the-brink-of-death"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://prospect.org/article/needless-default" target="_blank"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, so let me just illustrate with a story: Robynne Fauley of Sandy, Oregon, is a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy who is probably going to be kicked out of her home on Monday. The case is an &lt;a href="https://livinglies.wordpress.com/2017/04/25/investigator-bill-paatalo-a-plea-to-these-conspirators-you-have-the-power-to-end-this-nightmare/" target="_blank"&gt;absolute mess&lt;/a&gt;, replete with a &lt;a href="http://bpinvestigativeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2008-Internal-Emails-MGC-RFC-Quality-Loan-Servicing-Fauley-Case.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;chain of internal emails&lt;/a&gt; going back nine years, showing bank employees plotting to fabricate documents so they can evict this woman once and for all. In the absence of accountability, this is what our system has devolved into: three line workers on an email chain figuring out how to squeeze foreclosures past a judge. When nobody pays a price for fraud, fraud proliferates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama's defenders call this irrelevant when lives are on the line with President Trump. But there will be another president someday (let's hope), and if Democrats ever want that kind of power, they'll have to stop pretending about their past, about where they stand while incomes stratify and power concentrates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, as long as everyone's telling a complete stranger what to do with $400,000, I'd say: give it to Robynne Fauley. She could use it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow David Dayen on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ddayen" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link title="Obama Has Always Been Cool with Taking Wall Street Cash" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/obama-wall-street-speech-cash-trump" type="text/html"/><link title="Obama Has Always Been Cool with Taking Wall Street Cash" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/59022cdda1cb6069bbe4fca9/lede/1493324643416-Obama_400K.jpeg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>David Dayen</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>David Dayen</id></author><category term="money"/><category term="VICE US"/><category term="WALL STREET"/><category term="Corruption"/><category term="foreclosure"/><category term="finance"/><category term="barack obama"/><category term="regulation"/><category term="banks"/><category term="Views My Own"/><category term="Dodd-Frank"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-27-21</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-27T21:51:44.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>58b024a66a9ac0645f6fb561</id><published>2017-04-27T21:45:00.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-27T21:45:00.000Z</updated><title>OKO Šćepe</title><link title="OKO Šćepe" rel="alternate" href="https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/oko-scepe/58b024a66a9ac0645f6fb561" type="text/html"/><link title="OKO Šćepe" rel="enclosure" href="https://video-images.vice.com/videos/58/b0/58b024a66a9ac0645f6fb561/58b024a66a9ac0645f6fb561-1493212167454.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><author><name>Ana Todorovski</name><uri></uri><email></email><id>Ana Todorovski</id></author><category term="documentary"/><category term="Flu"/><category term="beograd"/><category term="Italija"/><category term="boks"/><category term="slikarstvo"/><category term="vladislav šćepanović šćepa"/><category term="Muzej primenjene umetnosti"/><category term="venecijansko bijenale"/><category term="venecija"/><source><id>vice-2017-4-27-21</id><title>vice</title><subtitle>RSS feed for https://www.vice.com</subtitle><updated>2017-04-27T21:46:35.000Z</updated><link title="vice" rel="alternate" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us" type="text/html"/><link title="" rel="superfeedr" href="http://www.vice.com/rss"/></source></entry><entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:geo="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:as="http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/" xmlns:sf="http://superfeedr.com/xmpp-pubsub-ext" xml:lang="en"><id>590134c57b10e05eebf48a18</id><published>2017-04-27T21:02:00.000Z</published><updated>2017-04-27T21:02:00.000Z</updated><title>Caitlyn Jenner's Memoir is a Lost Opportunity to Educate Cis America</title><summary type="text">It's packed with contradictions about her relationship with gender, and that may confuse readers more than it will help them.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt; "I want to be accessible," writes Caitlyn Jenner in her new memoir, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-My-Life-Caitlyn-Jenner/dp/1455596752" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Secrets of My Life&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. "&lt;/i&gt;[C]hanging attitudes may be the hardest societal task of all. The best way for me to do that is to meet people and show them I am friendly and 'normal'."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Since coming out as transgender on &lt;i&gt; 20/20&lt;/i&gt; in 2015, Jenner's made many attempts to get out there and meet people, from her bombshell &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Vanity Fair&lt;/i&gt; cover story&lt;/a&gt; to her politically-charged reality series &lt;a href="http://www.eonline.com/shows/i_am_cait" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt; I Am Cait&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt; Secrets&lt;/i&gt; is her most in-depth effort to humanize trans issues for the general public yet; in revealing all the gritty details of her lifelong struggle with gender dysphoria, the athlete-cum-reality star-cum-activist aims to wage a hearts-and-minds campaign for transgender rights. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It's not the worst idea, in theory. As &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jennifer-boylan-wants-less-gender-theory-more-justice"&gt;Jennifer Finney Boylan told &lt;i&gt; VICE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, "You can say what you like about Caitlyn Jenner, and a lot of what you would say I wouldn't disagree with, but the day after she came out, everyone in this country knew a transgender person." With Jenner's caliber of cultural saturation, as both a former athletic superstar and a reality TV A-lister, she's in a position to do a lot of good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In other words, when Jenner talks, Cisgender America, for the most part, listens. Her words would not carry such import if she were one of &lt;i&gt; many&lt;/i&gt; trans celebrities, but as that category remains woefully underpopulated, the influence she wields is massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Watch &lt;a href="https://video.vice.com/sv/video/ex-scientology-leader-and-trans-icon-kate-bornstein-on-what-it-takes-to-survive/578d4d0ba08feed57f407a56"&gt;Ex-Scientology Leader and Trans Icon Kate Bornstein on What It Takes to Survive:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-iframely-id="hmEDsXb" class="article__embed article__embed--iframely"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;" data-iframely-smart-iframe="true"&gt;&lt;iframe data-img="" data-iframely-url="//oembed.vice.com/hmEDsXb" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe="true" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenner claims in &lt;i&gt; Secrets&lt;/i&gt; that wielding this power isn't something she had in mind: "It is the media that has ordained me the spokesman for the transgender community," she claims, and anyway, "much of our fight is to get society to remove such meaningless labels as &lt;i&gt; representative." &lt;/i&gt;But she nonetheless &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/821811789285330944" target="_blank"&gt;knows full well&lt;/a&gt; the duty of her position; "I have written this book because I am lucky to have a public platform and want to use it," she writes in &lt;i&gt;Secrets &lt;/i&gt;closing chapter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In focusing that platform through her own story, &lt;i&gt; Secrets&lt;/i&gt; needed to humanize herself and her struggle for the public while explaining her relationship with gender with as much clarity as possible. Success would mean a digestible, sympathetic account of one woman's dysphoria that could dispel confusion about the trans experience among cis readers. It's unfortunate, then, that while she handily ensnares the reader's sympathies, Jenner contradicts herself so extensively as to render her relationship with gender inscrutable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jenner's life at the intersection of transness and celebrity is as accidental as it is unique. It's hard not to feel for her in particular when she describes the consequences of hypervisibility. Having lived under intense pressure to be masculine and the constant threat of international ridicule, it's impressive she managed to keep her head together for so long. In &lt;i&gt; Secrets,&lt;/i&gt; Jenner recalls close shaves with being recognized while &lt;i&gt; en femme&lt;/i&gt; in public, how staying in the closet damaged her marriages, and how gossip reporters once drove her to contemplate suicide:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="article__blockquote"&gt; I have already been labeled a freak in the tabloids. It will only get worse… I am still in the process of talking to each of [my children] to explain the gender issues I have had all my life. And now they are going to see some story that humiliates them and humiliates me. I keep thinking the same thought.&lt;i&gt; You keep a gun in the house. Why not use it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It's chilling to consider what one might have done when placed in Jenner's shoes (whether track or flats). Though Jenner hasn't had the hardest life, she nevertheless faced down some mighty demons—and did so with good humor, all things considered ("if I know anything about myself," she quips slyly, "it's that the legs work").&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But clarity begins to go out the window when she attempts to define her relationship with gender, arguably &lt;i&gt; Secrets&lt;/i&gt;' most vital purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Wrapping up her prologue—a story about delivering corporate motivational speeches while yearning to get back to her hotel room and ditch the suit—Jenner states bluntly: "I do what I do best: I play Bruce." That's a perfectly reasonable and common way of describing one's experience of trans identity, and one Jenner goes back to fairly often: she calls living as Bruce a "façade," laments not telling her father she "never really was [Bruce]" before he died, and so on. "I seriously think about putting a stipulation into my will that I be buried as was always my gender," she writes during a pre-transition story. "Maybe that's the best and only answer to be the woman I always was… for more than twenty minutes in a hotel lobby…" &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But just as often, Jenner takes a far different approach: that of "the woman inside me," the feeling "almost like I was two people." "Bruce was not a lie," she writes, but "a good man" and "a valuable part of my life." At one point, Jenner reveals that she kept her old breast forms and hip pads because "they symbolize my struggle &lt;i&gt; when I was Bruce&lt;/i&gt;" (emphasis added). Again, reasonable and common—but a big shift in tone and intent from her other statements. How can "Bruce" be a lie and not a lie at the same time? Was "Bruce" a fiction made fact by necessity? Readers are left to speculate for themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jenner claims elsewhere that while her gender "has always been female," "I &lt;i&gt; was&lt;/i&gt; a man who decide[d] to wear a dress when his wife and kids are away." Muddying the waters further are her assertions that while "Bruce was gone" after changing her birth certificate, he is also still around "on the inside, where he will happily remain for the rest of my days."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; How best to describe Caitlyn Jenner's experience of transness, then? Can all these contradictions exist in one person? If even a trans woman like myself can't parse a narrative meant to educate cis people about what it's like to be trans, what exactly is accomplished here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At best, &lt;i&gt; The Secrets of My Life&lt;/i&gt; bolsters its author's social capital while failing to make the idea of trans identities—even Jenner's own—any more understandable for the average reader. If anything, it makes that concept &lt;i&gt; harder&lt;/i&gt; for others to explain. Jenner has done some good work in raising money for trans charities, but this attempt at direct education falls flat, and that failure has consequences. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To be clear, this isn't a callout of Jenner for being toxic. That's &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/caitlyn-jenner-wants-to-be-ted-cruzs-trans-ambassador-1762666412" target="_blank"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theestablishment.co/its-time-to-ignore-caitlyn-jenner-e12a275c2b71" target="_blank"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, and if I wanted to beat that particular dead horse, I'd be pointing to antagonistic chapters about how Jenner's critics among the trans community—described in similar terms as the paparazzi she so despises—are "hostile" people with ideas that aren't connected to reality and who need to "get a life." I'm hurt and angered by those words and many more, but I'm also not the person who's supposed to read this book: it's for curious cis people who want to understand, from someone who wants to be America's Trans Friend. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "My word is not gospel," Jenner disclaims. That's certainly so, but as someone trying to command an extremely large and timely spotlight, Jenner has a responsibility to make her advocacy effective and clear. In &lt;i&gt; The Secrets of My Life, &lt;/i&gt;it is lamentably neither—a failing the trans community cannot afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Sam Riedel on &lt;a
