  It seems that the GOP, which has owned every branch of government and lever of power, since January, will at last have an "accomplishment" - &nbsp;a Tax Bill they admit will add a trillion dollars to the national debt, while offering
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/business/tax-bill-offers-last-minute-breaks-for-developers-banks-and-oil-industry.html">

   this

  &nbsp;time the oligarchs
  <i>
   will
  </i>
  spend their windfall on R&amp;D and productive capacity and jobs&hellip; unlike every single other time, when they spent it all on passive asset bubbles, exactly as Adam Smith predicted, back in 1776.

   Smith warned that aristocrats
  </a>
  &mdash; like the ones our U.S. Founders rebelled-against &mdash; tend
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  to spend infusions of cash on risky capital formation, or research, or factories. Generally 90% of them will plow it into &lsquo;
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">
   rent-seeking
  </a>
  &rsquo; assets like stocks or land, where they can passively collect dividends or gains.
  (Note that every tax break in this bill favored passive income, not wages you actually earn through work.)&nbsp;
 </span>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <br/>
 </span>
 <span>
  As in King George&rsquo;s time, top cronies adjust the laws to favor rent-grabbing assets over innovation, production or work. Smith would be outraged today&hellip; but not surprised.

<div>
 <span>
  Of course there is an
  <i>
   end game to asset bubbles,
  </i>
  and that end-game is the elephant in the room! One that, so far, no clever pundit has raised, amid all the yelling over this tax bill... an important aspect of the legislation that matters far more that the petty attacks on higher education and science, or the open war waged upon Blue States. I'll get to this invisible pachyderm, in a moment.

 <span>
  40 years,
 </span>
 <span>
  &nbsp;this Supply Side incantation
  <i>
   never
  </i>
  came true. Ever. Once.
 </span>
 <span>
  The eras of highest U.S. growth, rising wages and middle class health all took place under high tax rates established by the Greatest Generation, in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Except for the JFK rate cuts, every other cut was followed by
 </span>
 <i>
  reduced
 </i>
 <span>
  growth rates.

 <span>
  orporations have been mostly very profitable.
 </span>
 <span>
  They already had tons of cash on-hand, in the USA, to invest in production, jobs or R&amp;D, but those investments&nbsp;
 </span>
 <i>
  declined
 </i>
 <span>
  . Their bulging cash larders were spent instead on
 </span>
 <i>
  dividends
 </i>
 <span>
  and
 </span>
 <i>
  stock buybacks
 </i>
 <span>
  that helped their CEOs to meet performance criteria for their vampiric option plans.

  3) Any &ldquo;competitive disadvantage&rdquo; from other nations&rsquo; lower corporate rates might have been dealt with by negotiating a world treaty balancing such rates. It&rsquo;s happened before! Sure, negotiations might not work, this time. But there&rsquo;s no mention of even
  <i>
   trying

  , only a race to the bottom.

  5) If this Tax bill had anything to do with investment in new products etc., it&nbsp;would have

  Look across the era since Adam Smith wrote
  <i>
   &nbsp;
   <a href="http://amzn.to/2A2B5a6">
    The Wealth of Nations.
   </a>
  </i>
  Every generation of Americans since then has witnessed attempted political and economic putsches by would-be aristocrats gaming the rules so they can get richer without working or producing. Instead, as Smith described, they heap wealth into passive (rent or dividend or capital gains or parasitic-commission bleeding) assets. They do this because it&rsquo;s far easier than putting &ldquo;skin&rdquo; into actually producing goods and services.
 </span>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 <span>
  They also do this because sweetheart legislation makes it a great deal! But the smart ones know
  <i>
   there is a price.
  </i>
 </span>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 <span>
  That price is an ASSET BUBBLE.
  We&rsquo;ve seen many in our lifetimes: commodities, housing, real estate, banking and now a hyper-inflated stock market, with price to-earnings ratios that seem straight from the Twilight Zone. Those who piled their earlier tax largesse into asset bubbles know
  <i>
   the great times always end.

  And hence, being clever, they always plan an exit strategy, for when the bubble bursts.
 </span>
</div>
<div>

<div>
 <span>
  The dream strategy concocted during our previous two bubbles used to be
  <i>
   "privatize social security!"&nbsp;
  </i>
  Get every middle class bumpkin to funnel his or her SSI account into stocks during a market peak! Fill equity markets with Greater Fools to sop up bloated assets, so the current (rich) owners can cash-out at top prices.&nbsp;
 </span>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <br/>
 </span>
 <span>
  That scam was stopped, thank God, just before the last collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereupon Republicans suddenly lost interest in privatizing Social Security.
  Go figure!
 </span>

 <span>
  <b>
   So what's the plan now?
  </b>
 </span>
</div>
<div>
 <br/>
</div>
<div>
 <span>
  Send hundreds of billions of tax-bennies to already profitable corporations!
  Without any requirements or incentives to actually spend any of it on R&amp;D or factories or jobs, members of the inbred, incestuously conniving &ldquo;CEO caste&rdquo; of 5000 golf buddies will know what to do, with a nod and wink.

<div>
 <i>
  <span>
   Accelerate their already absurdly massive stock buy-backs!

  &nbsp; (There are reasons why this was illegal, during the Greatest Generation.) Break the U.S. budget subsidizing companies to squander their futures, giving money to
  <i>

  stockholders... buying up stock that the moguls know will soon plummet in value.
 </span>

  That was more than three decades before the collapse of the economy in 1929. The crash followed a decade of Republican control of the federal government during which trickle-down policies, including massive tax cuts for the rich, produced the greatest concentration of income in the accounts of the richest 0.01 percent at any time between World War I and 2007. Those disparities were brought to their minimum under FDR and Eisenhower, with tax rates and policies that were ratified over and over by the Greatest Generation.

  We need to study them, and how they achieved all that they did in a spirit of moderation and enterprise. Especially,

  One major danger of the right's current madness is that the left might over-react, returning to its own past insanities. The

 </span>
 <i>
  cheaters
 </i>
 <span>
  have betrayed not just the poor and middle class, but also enterprise, innovation, genuine market economics, common sense, national self-interest and even Adam Smith! The articles and studies get better and better, making the clear case that market enterprise works, but only when cheating is tymied. (I've published a few there.)&nbsp;
 </span>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <br/>
 </span>
 <span>
  If your cousin is one of that vanishing breed - a residually sane Republican - take her to Evonomics and tell her: "Only you can save enterprise capitalism from its age-old foe. Not socialism so much, but

  Which brings me to my question. You&rsquo;d have to be deaf and blind not to see the signs of a growing movement of American conservatives who are fed-up... not just with Bannon and Putin and their Trump, but with Rupert Murdoch and the insanity promulgated by Clear Channel Radio. Signs are all there -
  <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/10/mitt-romney-senate-utah-244760">
   especially among the Mormons

  - that vigorous conversations are afoot about holding a convention of Sane American Conservatives.
